The study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health, human health and resource depletion.
Ecological economist Herman Daly asked, "what use is a sawmill without a forest?"
Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms.
Specific types of sustainability include, sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture or ecological economics.
The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved.
However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins.
The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.
In fact, the three pillars are interdependent, and in the long run none can exist without the others.
Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness&nbsp;– everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail.
By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year.
In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes.
The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems.
A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.
Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer.
Eco-municipalities take a systems approach, based on sustainability principles.
# To develop a global partnership for development
The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years, in particular in the food industry.
Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics.
Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects.
Stabilizing the world’s climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO2 levels at 450–650&nbsp;ppm from current levels of about 380&nbsp;ppm.
In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced.
For example, he likens human existence on Earth&nbsp;— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources&nbsp;— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water.
There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation.
Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization.
Further, it is humane and just, protecting farmers and other workers, consumers, and communities."
In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year&nbsp;– three times its current rate of consumption&nbsp;– unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.
# To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science, environmental science and conservation biology.
Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world’s forests have been lost to human use.
Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of “resource wars”.
It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable.
Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.
The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods.
Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements.
An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book ''Limits to Growth'', which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis.
In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.
Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality.
However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce”.
This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment'.
The name sustainability is derived from the Latin ''sustinere'' (''tenere'', to hold; ''sub'', up).
The focus ranges from the total carrying capacity (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on.
Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.
But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes, at all levels and contexts of society.
at a certain point, at which the system’s underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens.” They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e.
Both trends started in the 1980s.
The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment.
Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering, environmental resources management and environmental protection.
Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them.
The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use.
Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.
A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems.
The United Nations has recognised the central role of education, and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development, 2005–2014, which aims to "challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future".
One such pillar is future generations, which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability.
Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity.
Synthetic chemical production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second World War.
Every economic activity produces material that can be classified as waste.
The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors, including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production.
# To achieve universal primary education
In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human greenhouse effect, produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels.
A study from 2005 pointed out that environmental justice is as important as is sustainable development.
In 2007 climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO2 was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use.
This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators.
However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system.
Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary.
Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs.
However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption, so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.
Sustainability economics represents: "...&nbsp;a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective.
Information is gained from green chemistry, earth science, environmental science and conservation biology.
In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.
Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as Bridges to Prosperity's use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.
Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality; and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.
Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.
Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.
This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.
Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.
Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS), a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment.
From this perspective, the economy is a subsystem of human society, which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere, and a gain in one sector is a loss from another.
Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including hazardous substances), manufactured products, food, living organisms and waste.
Engineering of emerging technologies such as carbon-neutral fuel and energy storage systems such as power to gas, compressed air energy storage, and pumped-storage hydroelectricity are necessary to store power from transient renewable energy sources including emerging renewables such as airborne wind turbines.
fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g.
The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves "the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits.
Despite the increased popularity of the use of the term "sustainability", the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been, and continues to be, questioned—in light of environmental degradation, climate change, overconsumption, population growth and societies' pursuit of indefinite economic growth in a closed system.
At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles.
The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health.
These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a bioregional economy.
It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world ecosystems, reducing both their resilience and biocapacity.
Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels has been a major driver of technology which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power.
The Ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen.
Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources.
As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that "business cannot succeed in societies that fail".
Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired.
The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and  Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives.
In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of adaptation as an ecosystem returns to viability from an external disturbance.
Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable.
Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability.
The report refers to natural systems as humanity's "life-support system", providing essential "ecosystem services".
Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable.
They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.
On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.
Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics.
In ecology, '''sustainability''' (from ''sustain'' and ''ability'') is the property of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely.
Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.
Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.
For example, industrial waste can be treated as an "economic resource in the wrong place".
A 2012 review in ''Nature'' by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be "approaching a state shift" in its biosphere.
At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming.
The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index (a measure of standard of living).
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital.
There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management.
The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at junctures or events where the combination of naturally occurring regenerative forces (solar energy, water, soil, atmosphere, vegetation, and biomass) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.
In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.
To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the ''quality of life'' rather than the ''standard of living''.
Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.
More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the Circles of Sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.
is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet.”
When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure.
The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable.
The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable.
The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.
Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive.
Sustainability can also be defined as a socio-ecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal.
According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world’s poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates.
Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.
To reduce waste, industry, business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by industrial metabolism into resource.
Ten per cent of the world's population&nbsp;– about 600 million people&nbsp;– live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.
As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials.
Dematerialization is being encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology, ecodesign and ecolabelling.
It has also been described as a "dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development".
Sustainable business practices, on the other hand, integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones (i.e., the triple bottom line).
In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed.
Reducing greenhouse emissions, is being tackled at all scales, ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the carbon cycle to the commercialization of renewable energy, developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use.
The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.
The Earth Charter speaks of “a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace.” This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability, which included the importance of the domain of 'politics'.
This in accord with the United Nations Agenda 21, which specifies '''culture''' as the fourth domain of sustainable development.
Scientists have warned of the possibility, under the influence of climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe.
One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to "internalize" these "externalities" by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services.
::: Where: I = Environmental impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology
One approach to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production.
Other approaches, loosely based around New Urbanism, are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport.
This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.
Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation.
Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability, or a quadruple bottom line.
Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.
Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2&nbsp;°C to produce “catastrophic” climate change.
Such acknowledgment has been made by the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals.
:::::::: I = P × A × T
“Low-risk” technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient.
Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g.
This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, environmental damage and resource depletion.
In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products.
A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.
Water security and food security are inextricably linked.
Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow, so the environment declines.
The European Union is expected to table by the end of 2015 an ambitious Circular Economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management, ecodesign and limits on land fills.
Both diets are low in meat and saturated fats and high in legumes and other vegetables; they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact.
Sustainability science is the study of sustainable development and environmental science.
While the United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social sustainability.
One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the I PAT formula.
This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy&nbsp;– especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents.
The equation is expressed:
The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability.
Healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other organisms.
In addition to the well-established “reduce, reuse and recycle,” shoppers are using their purchasing power for ethical consumerism.
The ''Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth’s ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers.
On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.
There is concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base.
Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate.
By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises (ecological economics, environmental economics, green economy) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism’s structural failures.
Social disruptions like war, crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need, damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future, and generally threaten human well-being and the environment.
These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities.
Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface.
The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade and UTZ Certified.
Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.
This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity.
Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses.
From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts.
The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.
In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.
Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.
An ideal is by definition unattainable in a given time/space but endlessly approachable and it is this endless pursuit that forms a sustainable system in the process (ibid).
"The relationship between human rights and human development, corporate power and environmental justice, global poverty and citizen action, suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice."
“High-risk” technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected.
A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy.
As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.
Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.
It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation.
There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the American Planning Association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles.
Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like "liberty" or "justice".
For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.
Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed "uneconomic growth" as it leads to a decline in quality of life.
The MDGs were established in 2000 following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations.
The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.
According to the data that member countries represented to the United Nations, Cuba was the only nation in the world in 2006 that met the World Wide Fund for Nature's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5, and a Human Development Index of over 0.8, 0.855.
These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.
Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism.
From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled&nbsp;— agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%.
# To reduce child mortality
Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation.
