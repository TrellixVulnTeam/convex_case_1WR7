In general, national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15-25% of married Americans reported having extramarital affairs.
These transformations may be attributed to the changing labor markets, marital tax laws along with new and different value sets and lifestyles.
'''Anonymous sexual interactionism''' refers to these individuals’ predilection for anonymous interactions of a sexual nature in chat rooms.
The new-found popularity of Internet chat rooms has contributed largely to infidelity.
Depending on the context, men and women can experience social consequences if their act of infidelity becomes public.
# romantic infidelity
Current research offers a three-phase model based on the pattern of experiences shared by participants in a qualitative study done by Olson, et al.
In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.
It is important to note that the negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship, and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction, motives for infidelity, level of conflict, and attitudes held about infidelity do (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).
A 2015 study found a correlation between ''AVPR1A'' expression and predisposition to extrapair mating in women but not in men.
Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.
* Regular sexual intercourse
In an attempt to differentiate offline and online infidelity, Cooper, Morahan-Martin, Mathy, and Maheu constructed a "Triple A Engine", which identifies the three aspects of Internet infidelity that distinguish it, to some degree, from traditional infidelity:
Some research has also suggested that being African American has a positive correlation to infidelity even when education attainment is controlled for.
According to Dr. Debra Laino in an article for ''Shave'', some of the reasons women cheat at the workplace are because "women are disproportionately exposed to men in the workplace, and, as a direct consequence, many have more options and chances to cheat."
In addition researchers have also proposed the idea that high mortality rates in local cultures should be correlated with more  permissive mating strategies.
In Blow's data set, men were found to be only “somewhat” more likely than women to engage in infidelity, with rates for both sexes becoming increasingly similar.
Studies have found that men are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied sexually, while women are more likely to engage in sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally.
More men than women indicated that a partner’s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner’s emotional bonding with someone else.
These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well (Hirsch ''et al.''
* Talking with an attractive stranger
One of the biggest problems with sexuality research is that many people will not openly admit to acts of infidelity unless they are assured complete anonymity.
Each case of infidelity serves a different purpose.
'''Commemorative infidelity''' occurs when a person has completely fallen out of love with their spouse, but is still in a committed relationship with them.
While infidelity is by no means exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors.
'''Stage two: moratorium''' – The moratorium is a less emotional period where there are less ups and downs in which the cheated-on spouse tries to make sense of the infidelity, obsesses about details of the affair, retreats physically and emotionally from the relationship, and reaches out to others for help.
Symons suggests that all men are innately disposed to want sexual variation and that the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men is that homosexual men can find willing partners more often for casual sex, and thus satisfy this innate desire for sexual variety.
* Exchanging contact details
A possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly.
As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options.
For one researcher, Symons (1979), sexual jealously is the major cause that homosexual men are supposedly unsuccessful in maintaining monogamous relationships (Harris, 2002).
Firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct.
(1999) reported that even though 60 percent of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship, a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).
What constitutes an act of infidelity is dependent upon the exclusivity expectations within the relationship.
Some studies suggest that only a small percentage of couples that experience infidelity actually improve their relationship, whereas some studies report couples having surprisingly positive relationship outcomes (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).
Support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with lower sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with higher sex ratios.
(see Adultery laws) Even where infidelity is not a criminal offense, it may have legal implications in divorce cases, for example it may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc.
Swinging was originally called “wife-swapping” but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners, “mate swapping” and or “swinging” was substituted (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
However the evidence for this gender difference is debatable, as new findings are suggesting that more and more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse (Harris, 2002).
Even within Christianity in the United States, there are discrepancies as to how extramarital affairs are viewed.
In this community, men having extramarital were extremely tactful in that they desired to do so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STI’s).
However, everyone feels differently, leading to extreme gray areas.
Fewer people are choosing to get married and instead are assuming relationships similar to marriage, without the title.
In particular because both men and women can have multiple partners, these individuals do not consider themselves to be either uncommitted or unfaithful (Ritchie and Barker, 2006).
The following factors were investigated: (a) what elements and dynamics online infidelity involves and how it happens; (b) what leads individuals specifically to the computer to search for a relationship ‘‘on the side’’; (c) whether individuals consider online contacts as infidelity and why or why not; and (e) what dynamics chat room users experience in their marriages.
The basis behind this argument is that jealousy was beneficial in our ancestor’s time when cuckoldry was more common (Buss et al., 1992).
The detection of unsuspected illegitimacy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing.
Additionally, there is confusion as to what exactly constitutes infidelity.
A study by Beatriz Lia Avila Mileham in 2004 examined the phenomenon of online infidelity in chat rooms, a process whereby individuals involved in a long-term committed relationship seek computer synchronous, interactive contact with opposite-sex members.
These patterns are observed in other cultures as well.
Furthermore, within a "homogeneous culture," like that in the United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived.
A study done by Harris (2002) tested these hypotheses among 210 individuals, 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men.
Larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues.
# Anonymous sexual interactionism
The rise of the Internet and technology in general provide new challenges for modern and homosexual couples.
(iii) It can  function as a motivational mechanism that creates behavioral outputs to deter infidelity and abandonment.
Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an  informal remark at a 1972 conference.
Chat rooms provide a dilemma because some view them as a forum for fantasies and illusions that are simply just communication rather than physical acts.
A more recently suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention and research is the idea that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their individual reputation (Fisher et al., 2009).
Such provisions have been condemned by the Council of Europe and the United Nations in recent years.
It is important to note that there are many other factors that increase the likelihood of anyone engaging in infidelity.
# '''Affordability:''' the monetary cost of being able to access the Internet continues to drop, and for a small price, a user can visit many sites, and meet multiple potential sexual needs
"Mate poaching" is the phenomenon of a single person luring a person who is in an intimate relationship to have sex outside of that relationship.
This case is paradigmatic in that it organizes social judgments about which other activities count as sexual, and also connects to dominant views about what sex is normal, natural and good."
From an evolutionary perspective, men are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as little as possible in their offspring and producing as many offspring as possible, due to the risk of males investing in children that are not theirs.
(ii) It can be activated by the presence of interested and more desirable intrasexual rivals.
According to the Global Internet Statistics in 2003, Internet population around the world has grown exceptionally fast in less than a decade, rising from 16 million users in 1995 to approximately 680 million in late 2003.
Swinging is a form of extradyadic sex where married couples exchange partners with each other.
For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these “individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles”.
For instance, Protestants and Catholics do not view infidelity with equal severity.
Atkins, Eldridge, Baucom, and Christiansen (2005) found that couples who went through therapy as well as openly dealt with the infidelity were able to change at a faster rate than other distressed couples who were just in therapy (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).
In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, Harris (2003) asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise.
However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view.
It is important to note however that their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing, however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style.The authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results.
It is important to understand where these cultural variations come from and how they root themselves into differing perceptions of infidelity.
In one study by Blow, rates were higher in more recent marriages, compared with previous generations.
Unlike polygyny or polyandry, both men and women may have multiple partners within the confines of polyamory.
All countries in Europe, as well as most countries in Latin America have decriminalized adultery, however in many countries in Africa and Asia (particularly the Middle East) this type of infidelity is criminalized.
As the sheer number of women in the workforce is now matching the same numbers of men, researchers expect that as workplace interaction between the sexes increases, the likelihood of infidelity will also increase (Kuroki, 2010).
One measure of infidelity is covert illegitimacy, a situation which arises when someone who is presumed to be a child's father (or mother) is in fact not the biological father (or mother).
Differences in sexual infidelity as a function of gender have been commonly reported.
"We have two brain systems: One of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, and then there is the other brain system, which is purely sex drive."
Jealousy is a form of stress response which has been shown to activate the Sympathetic nervous system by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.
# '''Accessibility:''' the more access one has to the Internet, the more likely they will engage in infidelity
Quite simply, women intersect with more people during the day than they used to.
For example, in a study by Sangrin & Guadango (2005), the authors found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity.
In more recent nationwide surveys, several researchers found that about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair.
For example, Schmitt discusses how tribal cultures with higher pathogen stress are more likely to have polygynous marriage systems; whereas monogamous mating systems usually have relatively lower high-pathogen environments.
# conflicted romantic infidelity, and
Social monitoring therefore enables them to act accordingly before infidelity occurs, thereby having the capability to raise their fitness (Harris, 2004).
Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs.
According to Christine Harris and Nicholas Christenfeld (1996), societies that are legally more liberal against extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity because it is distinct from emotional infidelity.
Similarly, in the dilemma involving infidelity over the Internet, more men indicated their partner’s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner’s emotional bonding with someone else.
According to a survey of 16,964 individuals in 53 countries by David Schmitt (2001), mate poaching happens significantly more frequently in Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey and Lebanon, and less frequently in East Asian countries such as China and Japan.
# obligatory infidelity
These therapists provide the same mental health services as other therapists, but with a specific focus – a couple's relationship.
Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.
Interestingly enough, extramarital sex, with both partners being aware and consenting, can have positive effects on the relationship (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
Never before has it been so easy to engage in the dating scene and meet people while maintaining the stability of marriage.
This theory suggests that it is not sexuality that may lead to differences but that people are prone to jealousy in domains that are especially important to them.
Penalties for adultery range from life imprisonment in Michigan, to a ten dollar fine in Maryland or "Class 1" felony in Wisconsin.
This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is social gossip about the behaviour.
Reasons for getting involved in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences, pleasure or excitement, meeting new people and voyeurism (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
They suggested that those who were equipped with this emotional response could more effectively stop infidelity and those without the emotional response had a harder time doing so.
The parental investment theory is used to explain evolutionary pressures that can account for sex differences in infidelity.
DeSteno and Bartlett (2002) further support this argument by providing evidence which indicates that significant results of forced-choice studies may actually be an artifact of measurement; this finding would invalidate many of the claims made by those "in favor" of an "innate" sex difference.
From this study, it is clear that context plays a role in the responses men and women give researchers and therefore how sex-differences are interpreted.
With time to heal and the mutual goal of rebuilding the relationship, some couples emerge from infidelity with a stronger and more honest relationship than before.
Kuroki found married women were less likely to have a workplace affair whereas individuals who are self-employed are more likely to have had an extramarital affair.
It is more common for men compared to women to engage in extradyadic relationships.
In many jurisdictions, adultery may have indirect legal implications, particularly in cases of infliction of violence, such as domestic assaults and killings, in particular by mitigating murder to manslaughter, or otherwise providing for partial or complete defenses in case of violence, especially in cultures where there is a traditional toleration of crimes of passion and honor killings.
What might start off as meaningless entertainment obtained by communicating with a stranger in a chat room could eventually lead to the establishment of an actual online or cyber relationship.
'''Stage three: trust-building''' – Trust-building is for couples who decided they wanted to stay together and make their marriage work.
These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion that there would be no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation; however more research in this area should be conducted.
In her meta-analysis, Harris (2003) raises the question of whether forced choice questionnaires actually measure what they purport: jealousy itself and evidence that differences in jealousy arise from innate mechanisms.
Because infidelity imposed such a fitness cost, those who had the jealous emotional response, improved their fitness, and could pass down the jealousy module to the next generation (Buss 1996).
Another defense mechanism for preventing infidelity is by social monitoring and acting on any violation of expectations.
These suggestions are:
A study done by McKinnish (2007) found that those who work with a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex are more likely to be divorced due to infidelity.
(Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
These views are generally linked to the overall liberal nature of the society.
These conflicting strategies are theorized to have resulted in selection of different jealousy mechanisms that are designed to enhance the fitness of the respective gender.
According to Henshel (1973) the initiation into the world of swinging usually is done by the husband.
Sex ratio theory is a theory that explains the relationship and sexual dynamics within different areas of the world based on the ratio of the number of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women.
A new type of sexual activity online is when two people’s avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such The Sims or Secondlife.
Recent studies suggest that in fact it may not be an innate mechanism but that it depends on the importance placed on sexual exclusivity.
A study done by Jenks in 1986 found that swingers are not significantly different from non-swingers on measures such as philosophy, authoritarianism, self-respect, happiness, freedom, equality etc.
After the ''Kinsey Reports'' came out in the early 1950s, findings suggested that historically and cross-culturally, extramarital sex has been a matter of regulation more than sex before marriage.
The participants were presented with four dilemmas concerning a partner’s emotional and sexual infidelity over the Internet.
Partners evaluate both the good and bad parts of their relationship.
Affairs range from one-night stands to relationships that last for years.
In their book, "The Philosophy of Sex", Alan Soble and Nicholas Power speculate about the Internet, infidelity and culture, "According to the dominant account in our culture, the paradigm case of what counts as sex is heterosexual intercourse, where a man and women engage in a particularly intimate form of physical contact, in which a penis penetrates a vagina.
Being able to justify the behavior of a spouse and define it will lessen some of the confusion.
(2005) reported of the 1828 participants they surveyed, one third of them reported engaging in cybersex and of that one third, 46% said they were in a committed relationship with someone else.
Support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region.
Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone.
This type of relationship typically contains the same elements that are found in a traditional relationship such as attraction, flirtation, and support.
The protection of the road offers a secret life of romance, far from spouses or partners.
'''Opportunistic infidelity''' occurs when a partner is in love and attached to a partner, but surrenders to their sexual desire for someone else.
(i) It can alert an individual to threats with a valued relationship.
According to anthropologist Helen Fisher, there are numerous psychological reasons for adultery.
A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China.
There are various types of relationships in polyamory such as intentional family, group relationship, and group marriage.
Results, however, vary year by year, and also by age-group surveyed.
The Kinsey Reports found that around half of men and a quarter of women studied had committed adultery.
In addition, recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking.
This variation stems from the fact that societies differ in how they view extramarital affairs and jealousy.
It would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city.
Relationship counseling can help put an affair into perspective, explore underlying relationship problems, teach how to rebuild and strengthen a relationship, and avoid divorce – if that is the mutual goal.
A common way to test whether an innate jealousy response exists between sexes is to use a forced-choice questionnaire.
Those that participated more heavily in their religions were even more conservative in their views on infidelity (Burdette ''et al.''
These inconsistent results have led researchers to propose novel theories that attempt to explain the sex differences observed in certain studies.One theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories.
A standardized definition of infidelity, used by the International Infidelity Law Consortium, includes the following acts:
Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place.
Gilmartin (1975) found that 85 percent of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved.
Cases have been commonly documented where sexual jealousy was a direct cause of murders and morbid jealousy.
The allure of anonymity gains extra importance for married individuals, who can enjoy relative safety to express fantasies and desires without being known or exposed.
The most recent findings by Daneback et al.
Marriage, sex, and childbearing, which have been a tightly bound package for much of the 20th century, are no longer so inextricably linked.
Another form of extradyadic sex is polyamory, a "non-possessive, honest, responsible and ethical philosophy and practice of loving multiple people simultaneously" (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
Buss and his colleagues (1992) were the first to pioneer a theory that jealousy is an evolved human emotion that has become an innate module, hard-wired to prevent infidelity from occurring.
Infidelities at work or office romances are thought to stem at an individual’s workplace.
A study by Liu found that the likelihood for women to be involved in infidelity reached a peak in the seventh year of their marriage and then declined afterwards; whereas for married men, the longer they are in relationships the less likely they are to engage in infidelity, except for the eighteenth year of marriage, at which point the chance that men will engage in infidelity increases.
In this circumstance the person feels s/he cannot tell his/her committed partner about what has happened, but is nevertheless unable to resist the compulsion; this lack of open discussion is usually what separates conflicted romantic infidelity from things like a well-defined open relationship or polyamory.
One type of group relationship can be a triad involving a married couple and an additional person who all share sexual intimacy, however it is usually an addition of a female (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).
Race and gender have been found to be positively correlated with infidelity, however this is the case more often for African American men engaging in extramarital infidelity.
Often, gender differences in both jealousy and infidelity are attributable to cultural factors.
* Sexual fantasy with someone outside marriage
), should be more choosy when it comes to mate selection and should therefore desire long-term, monogamous relationships that would ensure the viability of their offspring.
A de facto relationship may exist even when the partners do not think so.
The basis for this suggestion stems from the fact that humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless of the context (Scheuring, 2010).
Ultimately, it was seen that adults that associated with a religion (any denomination) were found to view infidelity as much more distressing than those who were not affiliated with a religion.
Strategic pluralism is a theory that focuses on how environmental factors influence mating strategies.
Swingers tend to emphasize personal values over more social ones.
Maximizing female fitness is theorized to require males in the relationship to invest all their resources in the offspring.
In other words, replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function.
A survey conducted in 1990 found 2.2% of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year.
In 2000 Treas and Giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months.
The emotional and physical aftermath after an affair has been disclosed can be very difficult, and responses can vary between couples.
'''Stage one: roller-coaster''' – The roller-coaster is a time filled with strong emotions, ranging from anger and self-blame to periods of introspection, awareness, appreciation for the relationship, desire to work on relationship or give up, and the realization about the truth of the relationship.
While face to face sexual scripts for individuals of what is acceptable have been readily available, with the creation of the Internet, the rules of what constitutes infidelity are not as clearly established anymore.
The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern.
Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.
They found a significant sex difference as to whether participants chose sexual and emotional infidelity as more upsetting.
Often a single predominant religion can influence the culture of an entire nation.
In some jurisdictions an extramarital affair may incur unexpected financial costs.
As a result, infidelity does not carry such a severe negative connotation (Harris and Christenfeld).
'''Conflicted romantic infidelity''' takes place when a person both falls in love with ''and'' has a strong sexual desire for ''multiple people at one time'', even though s/he may already be committed to a partner.
It is not surprising that human mating strategies differ from culture to culture.
The form and extent of these consequences are often dependent on the gender of the unfaithful person.
This style of questionnaire asks participants "Yes or No" and "Response A or Response B" style questions about certain scenarios.
In line with this reasoning, these researchers hypothesize that as a person monitors their partner’s actions with a potential rival through primary and secondary appraisals (Harris, 2004), if their expectations are violated at either level of observation, they will become distressed and enact an appropriate action to stop the chance of infidelity (Cramer et al., 2008).
Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy.
Happily married individuals also join such rooms.
Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary ''et al.''
Intimate betrayal inflicts an attachment wound and this is sometimes irreparable, particularly when both partners are not committed to repair.
This theory says that it is these evolutionary pressures that act on men and women differentially and what ultimately drives more men to seek sexual activity outside of their own relationships.
This provided an ultimate selection mechanism to make this module adaptive and still persist in today’s human population.
Sometimes these two brain systems are not well connected, which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their sex drive without any regards to their attachment side.
