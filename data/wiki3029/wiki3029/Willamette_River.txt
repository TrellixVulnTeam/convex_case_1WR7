They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding.
However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects.
A 1991 agreement between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project.

The name ''Willamette'' is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village.
Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river.
During the Pleistocene, beginning roughly 2.5&nbsp;million years ago, volcanic activity in the Cascades combined with a cool, moist climate to produce further heavy sedimentation across the basin; braided rivers created alluvial fans spreading down from the east.

The bill passed, but Governor Charles Martin vetoed it.
As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the  lower stretch from Portland to Oregon Cityâ€”which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River systemâ€”and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette's length.
These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas.
Although people had been traveling to Oregon since 1836, large-scale migration did not begin until 1843, when nearly 1,000 pioneers headed westward.

Since pollution concerns are primarily along the lower river, the Willamette in general scores relatively high on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI), which is compiled by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.
In the central valley, several projects have been done to restore and protect wetlands in order to provide habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's lupine.
Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force.
