Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.
All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called "life chances" (opportunities to improve one's life).
This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''Verstehen''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the "rational economic man" (''homo economicus''), which is at the heart of modern mainstream economics.
These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.
For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism did not begin with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy.
Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory.
In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber-Fechner law.
In 1888 he joined the ''Verein für Socialpolitik'', a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the historical school, who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues.

After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.
Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.
Weber's views on the war and the expansion of the German empire changed during the course of the conflict.

In this last respect, the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy is evident.
This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.
This distinction is most clearly described in Weber's essay "Classes, Staende, Parties" which was first published in his book Economy and Society.
The great differences between that school's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the neoclassical school (from which modern mainstream economics largely derives) on the other, explain why Weber's influence on economics today is hard to discern.
Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife.
His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.
Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism "from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense".
His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921–22.
They instead "advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness".
Weber's essay ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is his most famous work.
The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains.
In his own time, however, Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist.
However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference.
According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully inductive or descriptive, because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract "ideal (pure) types".
The ''Protestant Ethic'' formed the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into world religion; he went on to examine the religions of China, the religions of India and ancient Judaism, with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of social stratification.
Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.
Different elements of his thought were emphasised by Carl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, Ludwig Lachmann, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron.
In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of this tripartite distinction.

He also saw in the history of medieval European cities the rise of a unique form of "non-legitimate domination" that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination (traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal) that had prevailed until then in the Medieval world.
He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.
Weber regarded himself primarily as a "political economist", and all of his professorial appointments were in economics, though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology.
Weber's work in the field of sociology of religion started with the essay ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' and continued with the analysis of ''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'', ''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' and ''Ancient Judaism''.

While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned "iron cage" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.
It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations.
Weber began his studies of the subject in ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.
Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife.
Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun work on the book ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''.

In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models that Weber called "ideal types", from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors.
Weber's role in German politics remains controversial to this day.
The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ''ethic of attitude'' and the ''ethic of responsibility'' ("Verantwortungsethik vs Gesinnungsethik") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).
Weber also formulated a three-component theory of stratification, with social class, social status and political party as conceptually distinct elements.
He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state.

Many translations are made of parts or sections of various German originals and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of German work they contain.
"Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil....
His analysis of bureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on rational-legal authority

The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894, where Weber was appointed professor of economics at the university, before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896.
Related to rationalisation is the process of disenchantment, in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical, moving from polytheistic religions to monotheistic ones and finally to the Godless science of modernity.
Weber, like his colleague Werner Sombart, regarded economic calculation and especially the double-entry bookkeeping method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism.
