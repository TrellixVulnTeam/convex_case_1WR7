If 29 February falls within a Jewish month the first day of later months will be a day earlier than shown.
#Yom Shishi –  (abbr. )
Odd months have 30 days and even months 29, so the starting dates are 2, 15 July; 3, 13 August; 4, 12 September; 5, 11 October; 6, 10 November; 7, 9 December, and 8, 8 January.
For long period calculations, dates should be reduced to the Julian calendar and converted back to the civil calendar at the end of the calculation.
The practice of Judah is still followed.
The Jewish calendar's epoch (reference date), 1 Tishrei AM 1, is equivalent to Monday, 7 October 3761 BC/BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar, the equivalent tabular date (same daylight period) and is about one year ''before'' the traditional Jewish date of Creation on 25 Elul AM 1, based upon the ''Seder Olam Rabbah''.
When the difference goes above 18/19 month this signifies a leap year, and the difference is reduced by one month.
The ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' also recognized the importance of the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme.
That is either the same or the previous day in the civil calendar, depending on whether the difference in the day of the week is three or two days.
If 29 February is included fewer than five times in the nineteen - year period the date will be later by the number of days which corresponds to the difference between the actual number of insertions and five.
By his calculation, based on the Masoretic Text, Adam was created in 3760 BCE, later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist al-Biruni as 3448 years before the Seleucid era.
This table also identifies the seven types of common years and seven types of leap years.
Holidays and commemorations not derived from previous Jewish tradition were to be fixed according to the Hebrew calendar date.
In addition, an abbreviated Jubilee calendar from 4Q319 along with the priestly course serving on 1 Abib (the first day of the year) each year may be found  here.
#Yom Rishon –  (abbreviated ), meaning "first day" corresponds to Sunday (starting at preceding sunset of Saturday)
In Israel, it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture and is an official calendar for civil purposes, although the latter usage has been steadily declining in favor of the Gregorian calendar.
(Jerusalem is 35°13’ east of the prime meridian, so the antimeridian is at 144°47' W, passing through eastern Alaska.)
The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the "hours" of the daytime.
For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from February 29 (Julian date).
While calculations of days, months and years are based on fixed hours equal to 1/24 of a day, the beginning of each ''halachic'' day is based on the local time of sunset.
The Jewish day is modeled on the reference to "...there was evening and there was morning..." in the creation account in the first chapter of Genesis.
When the 19-year intercalary cycle was finalised in the 4th century, the earliest Passover (in year 16 of the cycle) coincided with the northward equinox, which means that Passover fell near the ''first'' full moon after the northward equinox, or that the northward equinox landed within one lunation before 16 days after the ''molad'' of ''Nisan''.
meaning "third day" corresponds to Tuesday
In subsequent verses the Hebrew refers to the days using ordinal numbers, e.g., 'second day', 'third day', and so forth, but with the sixth and seventh days the Hebrew includes the definite article ("the").
According to a statement attributed to Yose, an Amora who lived during the second half of the 3rd century, the feast of Purim, 14 Adar, could not fall on a Sabbath nor a Monday, lest 10 Tishrei (Yom Kippur) fall on a Friday or a Sunday.
The use of these dates has been in use for a long time.
Also known as Yom Shabbat Kodesh יום שבת קודש
It is so named because it identifies the four allowable days of the week on which  can occur.
The ''keviyah'' records whether the year is leap or common: פ for ''peshuta'' (פשוטה), meaning simple and indicating a common year, and מ indicating a leap year (me'uberet, מעוברת).
Since there is no year 0, a remainder of 0 indicates that the year is year 19 of the cycle.
Thus, adding 3760 before Rosh Hashanah or 3761 after to a Julian year number starting from 1 CE (AD 1) will yield the Hebrew year.
The modern molad moments match the mean solar times of the lunar conjunction moments near the meridian of Kandahar, Afghanistan, more than 30° east of Jerusalem.
The "lost" month would be "picked up" in the next cycle when Karaites would observe a leap month while other Jews would not.
Because of the displacements it actually begins on Saturday, 15 June.
Thus if the calculated value is -4 the civil equivalent of this date is February 24.
In (248x76) Julian years the Jewish year is due to start (248x3d 18h 12 4/18m) later in the week, which is 932d 2h 31 2/18m or 1d 2h 31 2/18m later after removing complete weeks.
Since the adoption of a fixed calendar, intercalations in the Hebrew calendar have been assigned to fixed points in a 19-year cycle.
In his work ''Mishneh Torah'' (1178), Maimonides included a chapter "Sanctification of the New Moon", in which he discusses the calendrical rules and their scriptural basis.
Both the Syrian calendar, currently used in the Arabic-speaking countries of the Fertile crescent, and the modern Assyrian calendar share many of the names for months with the Hebrew calendar, such as Nisan, Iyyar, Tammuz, Ab, Elul, Tishri and Adar, indicating a common origin.
Furthermore, the seasonal drift of the rabbinic calendar is avoided, resulting in the years affected by the drift starting one month earlier in the Karaite calendar.
The year may be intercalated on three grounds: 'aviv i.e.the ripeness of barley, fruits of trees, and the equinox.
(Ben-Dov, ''Head of All Years'', pp.&nbsp;19–20)
This can affect the dates observed for all the Jewish holidays in a particular year by one day.
This indicates that there was a group who "made computations" and were in a position to control, to some extent, the day of the week on which Rosh Hashanah would fall.
Since none of these values is evenly divisible by seven, the Jewish calendar repeats exactly only following 36,288 Metonic cycles, or 689,472 Jewish years.
For calendar descriptions in general the day begins at 6 p.m., but for the purpose of determining Rosh Hashanah, a ''molad'' occurring on or after noon is treated as belonging to the next day (the first ''deḥiyyah'').
These rules have been instituted because Shabbat restrictions also apply to Yom Kippur, so that if Yom Kippur were to fall on Friday, it would not be possible to make necessary preparations for Shabbat (such as candle lighting).
During the Hellenistic Maccabean period, Seleucid era counting was used, at least in the Greek-influenced area of Israel.
The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days (Succot and Passover) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the Jewish diaspora because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.
or ''AM'') for the era should properly ''precede'' the date rather than follow it.
But how can year 1 be lengthened if it is already a long ordinary year of 355 days or year 2 be shortened if it is a short leap year of 383 days?
The two months whose numbers of days may be adjusted, Marcheshvan and Kislev, are the eighth and ninth months of the Hebrew year, whereas Tishrei is the seventh month (in the traditional counting of the months, even though it is the first month of a new calendar year).
Fire-signals, for example, or smoke-signals, are known from the pre-exilic Lachish ostraca.
This is called deḥiyyah ''lo ADU,'' an acronym that means "not weekday one, four, or six."
*A ''kesidrah'' year ("regular" or "in-order") is 354 or 384 days long.
Another memory aid notes that intervals of the major scale follow the same pattern as do Jewish leap years, with ''do'' corresponding to year 19 (or 0): a whole step in the scale corresponds to two common years between consecutive leap years, and a half step to one common year between two leap years.
*If the molad in a common year falls on a Tuesday after 9 hours and 204 parts, Rosh Hashanah is postponed to Thursday.
Most are organised according to Gregorian rather than Jewish months, but begin in September, when the Jewish New Year usually falls, and provide the Jewish date in small characters.
For example, Jewish communities in the Babylonian diaspora counted the years from the first deportation from Israel, that of Jehoiachin in 597 BCE, (e.g., ).
# Libra - Moznayim - Tishrei
The second rule, (deḥiyyah ''lo ADU''), is applied for religious reasons.
# Sagittarius - Keshet - Kislev
The era used since the Middle Ages is the ''Anno Mundi'' epoch (Latin for "in the year of the world"; Hebrew:&nbsp;, "from the creation of the world").
(These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.)
If due to start on Saturday, it actually begins on the following day if the previous year was due to begin on Monday morning.
(Ben-Dov, ''Head of All Years'', pp.&nbsp;16–17)
The actual length of a synodic month varies from about 29 days 6 hours and 30 minutes (29.27 days) to about 29 days and 20 hours (29.83 days), a variation range of about 13 hours and 30 minutes.
Similarly, if Yom Kippur fell on a Sunday, it would not be possible to make preparations for Yom Kippur because the preceding day is Shabbat.
By the time of the redaction of the ''Mishnah'', Rosh Hashanah 1:1 (c. 200 CE), jurists had identified four new-year dates:
*A ''shlemah'' year ("complete" or "perfect", also "abundant") is 355 or 385 days long.
Håkan Ulfgard suggests that the use of what are rarely used Canaanite (or in the case of Ethanim perhaps Northwest-semitic) names indicates that "the author is consciously utilizing an archaizing terminology, thus giving the impression of an ancient story...".
The calendar rules have been designed to ensure that Rosh Hashanah does not fall on a Sunday, Wednesday or Friday.
Josephus writing in the Roman period also used Seleucid era dating exclusively.
Every nineteen years this time is 2 days, 16 hours, 33 1/18 minutes later in the week.
Not all the rules were in place by 835.
In 921, Aaron ben Meïr proposed changes to the calendar.
Just four potential conditions are considered to determine whether the date of Rosh Hashanah must be postponed.
According to some Christian and Karaite sources, the tradition in ancient Israel was that 1 Nisan would not start until the barley is ripe, being the test for the onset of spring.
The left number of each triple is the day of the week of , Rosh Hashanah ; the letter indicates whether that year is deficient (D), regular (R), or complete (C), the number of days in Chesvan and Kislev; while the right number of each triple is the day of the week of , the first day of Passover or Pesach , within the same Hebrew year (next Julian/Gregorian year).
To calculate the day on which Rosh Hashanah of a given year will fall, it is necessary first to calculate the expected molad (moment of lunar conjunction or new moon) of Tishrei in that year, and then to apply a set of rules to determine whether the first day of the year must be postponed.
Moses...appointed Nisan...as the first month for the festivals...the commencement of the year for everything relating to divine worship, but for selling and buying and other ordinary affairs he preserved the ancient order i. e. the year beginning with Tishrei."
# Taurus - Shor - Iyar
Secondly, one must determine the number of days between the starting Tishrei ''molad'' (TM1) and the Tishrei ''molad'' of the next year (TM2).
The '''Hebrew''' or '''Jewish calendar''' (, ''Ha-Luah ha-Ivri'') is a lunisolar calendar used today predominantly for Jewish religious observances.
Adar II (or Adar Bet &mdash; "second Adar") is the "real" Adar, and has the usual 29 days.
It has been noted that the procedures described in the Mishnah and Tosefta are all plausible procedures for regulating an empirical lunar calendar.
Today, the rules detailed in Maimonides' calendrical code are those generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.
Comparing the days of the week of molad Tishrei with those in the ''keviyah'' shows that during 39% of years  is not postponed beyond the day of the week of its molad Tishrei, 47% are postponed one day, and 14% are postponed two days.
stresses the importance in Israelite religious observance of the new month (Hebrew: , Rosh Chodesh, "beginning of the month"): "... in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings..." Similarly in .
The practice of the Kingdom of Israel was also that of Babylon, as well as other countries of the region.
During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th century, the center of world Judaism was in the Middle East, primarily in the Talmudic Academies of Iraq and Palestine.
The Talmud identified the twelve constellations of the zodiac with the twelve months of the Hebrew calendar.
While the ''keviyah'' is sufficient to describe a year, a variant specifies the day of the week for the first day of Pesach (Passover) in lieu of the year length.
Jewish funerary inscriptions from Zoar, south of the Dead Sea, dated from the 3rd to the 5th century, indicate that when years were intercalated, the intercalary month was at least sometimes a repeated month of Adar.
Also, the four rules of postponement of the rabbinic calendar are not applied, since they are not mentioned in the Tanakh.
), or more usually Shabbat –  = "Sabbath-rest day" corresponds to Saturday.
When to add it was based on observation of natural agriculture-related events.
The molad drift could be corrected by using a progressively shorter molad interval that corresponds to the actual mean lunar conjunction interval at the original molad reference meridian.
To assist in remembering this sequence, some people use the mnemonic Hebrew word  , where the Hebrew letters ''gimel-vav-het aleph-dalet-zayin-tet'' are used as Hebrew numerals equivalent to 3, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 9.
Dr. Irv Bromberg has proposed a 353-year cycle of 4366 months, which would include 130 leap months, along with use of a progressively shorter ''molad'' interval, which would keep an amended fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar from drifting for more than seven millennia.
Another two rules are applied much less frequently and serve to prevent impermissible year lengths.
In this case it is important to remember that when calculating the civil equivalent of February 29 (Julian), February 29 is discounted.
One scholar has noted that there are no laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate any doubts about the length of a month or of a year.
The Hebrew letter כ "kaf" is used in the ''keviyah''.
= "fifth day" corresponds to Thursday
Al-Khwarizmi's study of the Jewish calendar, ''Risāla fi istikhrāj taʾrīkh al-yahūd'' "Extraction of the Jewish Era" describes the 19-year intercalation cycle, the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrī shall fall, the interval between the Jewish era (creation of Adam) and the Seleucid era, and the rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Jewish calendar.
For example,  "... And there was evening and there was morning, one day".
Additionally, the laws of Shabbat override those of Hoshana Rabbah, so that if Hoshana Rabbah were to fall on Shabbat certain rituals that are a part of the Hoshana Rabbah service (such as carrying willows, which is a form of work) could not be performed.
Prior to the Babylonian exile, the names of only four months are referred to in the Tanakh:
(See Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, below.)
The Bible does not directly mention the addition of "embolismic" or intercalary months.
It determines the dates for Jewish holidays and the appropriate public reading of Torah portions, ''yahrzeits'' (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily Psalm readings, among many ceremonial uses.
To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2.
;Example calculation
In the 1st century, Josephus stated that while –
However, since the establishment of the State of Israel, and especially since the Six Day War, the Karaite Jews that have made ''aliyah'' can now again use the observational calendar.
The years of a 19-year cycle are organized into four groups: common years after a leap year but before a common year ; common years between two leap years ; common years after a common year but before a leap year ; and leap years , all between common years.
:1477/9=164 remainder 1
The writings often discuss the moon, but the calendar was not based on the movement of the moon any more than indications of the phases of the moon on a modern western calendar indicate that that is a lunar calendar.
A Jewish common year can only have 353, 354, or 355 days.
Nowadays, molad zaken is used as a device to prevent the molad falling on the second day of the month.
As Passover is a spring festival, it should fall on a full moon day around, and normally just after, the vernal (northward) equinox.
According to the ''Mishnah'' and Tosefta, in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new months were determined by the sighting of a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required to testify to the Sanhedrin to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset.
Civil date of first day of Jewish month
This table numbers the days of the week and hours for the limits of molad Tishrei in the Hebrew manner for calendrical calculations, that is, both begin at , thus  is noon Saturday.
Of course, the Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and at least part of the harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4.
These observations were compared against calculations.
Rav Aha b. Jacob then put this question: How do we know that our Era of Documents is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all?
This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional ''succah'' during Sukkot.
Prominent rabbis have on several occasions sharply denounced this practice, but with no noticeable effect on the secularist celebrants.
This gives an average of 6939 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts for each cycle.
The table below lists, for a Jewish year commencing on 23 March, the civil date of the first day of each month.
In early times, the years were counted from some significant historic event.
To determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle.
The mean period of the lunar month (precisely, the synodic month) is very close to 29.5 days.
The accuracy of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late Second Temple period is less certain.
However, without the insertion of embolismic months, Jewish festivals would gradually shift outside of the seasons required by the Torah.
#Yom Chamishi –  (abbr. )
Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event took place on the following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain.
H. Graetz  linked the introduction of the computed calendar to a sharp repression following a failed Jewish insurrection that occurred during the rule of the Christian emperor Constantius and Gallus.
Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean tropical year, so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean solar year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the Gregorian calendar year.
A Metonic cycle equates to 235 lunar months in each 19-year cycle.
meaning "fourth day" corresponds to Wednesday
Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.
#Yom Shabbat –  (abbr.
Cheshvan has 29 days while Kislev has 30 days.
Furthermore, two Jewish dates during post-Talmudic times (specifically in 506 and 776) are impossible under the rules of the modern calendar, indicating that its arithmetic rules were developed in Babylonia during the times of the Geonim (7th to 8th centuries).
Hence the court, not the astronomy, has the final decision.
As it cannot be postponed to Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday, and year 1 ends up with 354 days.
The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that months are based on lunar months, but years are based on solar years.
The ''keviyah'' in Hebrew letters are written right-to-left, so their days of the week are reversed, the right number for  and the left for .
At the innovation of the sages, the calendar was arranged to ensure that Yom Kippur would not fall on a Friday or Sunday, and Hoshana Rabbah would not fall on Shabbat.
That is the essential feature of the 353-year leap cycle ().
The postponement of the year is compensated for by adding a day to the second month or removing one from the third month.
For the dates of the Jewish New Year see Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000–2050 or calculate using the section "Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars".
One is that nothing was done and the calendar was allowed to change with respect to the seasons.
There are three qualities that distinguish one year from another: whether it is a leap year or a common year, on which of four permissible days of the week the year begins, and whether it is a deficient, regular, or complete year.
This is to ensure that Yom Kippur does not directly precede or follow Shabbat, which would create practical difficulties, and that Hoshana Rabbah is not on a Shabbat, in which case certain ceremonies would be lost for a year.
Edwin Thiele has concluded that the ancient northern Kingdom of Israel counted years using the ecclesiastical new year starting on 1 Aviv (Nisan), while the southern Kingdom of Judah counted years using the civil new year starting on 1 Tishrei.
By approximately 11 days.
*A ''chaserah'' year (Hebrew for "deficient" or "incomplete") is 353 or 383 days long.
It is identical to the Gregorian calendar between 15 October 1582 CE and 28 February 2400 CE (both dates inclusive).
In this case, year 2 is extended by one day by postponing Rosh Hashanah in year 3 from Monday to Tuesday (the fourth ''deḥiyyah'' ), and year 2 will have 383 days.
The era year was then called "year of the captivity of Jehoiachin".
Instead of the international date line convention, there are varying opinions as to where the day changes.
Later writers, such as Nachmanides, explained Hai Gaon's words to mean that the entire computed calendar was due to Hillel b. Yehuda in response to persecution of Jews.
# Aries - Taleh - Nisan
So in 20874 CE the Jewish year is due to begin 87d 2h 31 2/18m later than in 2026 CE and 1d 2h 31 2/18m later in the week.
The Jewish Shabbat has a special role in the Jewish weekly cycle.
It is to allow these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.
# Virgo - Betulah - Elul
Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand?
These names are only mentioned in connection with the building of the First Temple.
Some of the dates in the document are clearly corrupt, but they can be emended to make the sixteen years in the table consistent with a regular intercalation scheme.
Religious questions abound about how such a system might be implemented and administered throughout the diverse aspects of the world Jewish community.
The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting '''into'''.
(In most populated parts of the world this is always approximately 24 standard hours, but depending on the season of the year it can be slightly less or slightly more.)
The addition of the leap month (Adar II) is determined by observing in Israel the ripening of barley at a specific stage (defined by Karaite tradition) (called aviv), rather than using the calculated and fixed calendar of rabbinic Judaism.
The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until ''Shemini Atzeret'', after the end of Sukkot, yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.
Likewise, to prevent Hoshana Rabbah (21 Tishrei) from falling on a Saturday, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday.
The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week.
Adar I is actually considered to be the extra month, and has 30 days.
# Capricorn - Gdi - Tevet
During leap years Adar I (or Adar Aleph &mdash; "first Adar") is added before the regular Adar.
Most are represented in any 19-year cycle, except one or two may be in neighboring cycles.
In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example  (''Day 1'', or Yom Rishon ()):
There is a near-repetition every 247 years, except for an excess of about 50 minutes (905 parts).
Said Rav Nahman: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.
It should be noted that the 12 lunar months of the Hebrew calendar are the normal months from new moon to new: the year normally contains twelve months averaging 29.52 days each.
Today, the rules detailed in Maimonides' code are those generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.
Furthermore, the discrepancy between the molad interval and the mean synodic month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects.
(e.g., ) During the period of the monarchy, it was the widespread practice in western Asia to use era year numbers according to the accession year of the monarch of the country involved.
The weekdays start with Sunday (day 1, or ''Yom Rishon'') and proceed to Saturday (day 7), Shabbat.
In the 8th and 9th centuries, as the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, counting using the Seleucid era "became meaningless".
The 1st of Nisan is the new year for kings and feasts; the 1st of Elul is the new year for the tithe of cattle... the 1st of Tishri is the new year for years, of the years of release and jubilee years, for the planting and for vegetables; and the 1st of Shevat is the new year for trees-so the school of Shammai; and the school of Hillel say: On the 15th thereof.
Convert back to the civil calendar by applying the formula.
The correspondence of the constellations with their names in Hebrew and the months is as follows:
The Jewish calendar is based on the Metonic cycle of 19 years, of which 12 are common (non-leap) years of 12 months and 7 are leap years of 13 months.
In 1000, the Muslim chronologist al-Biruni described all of the modern rules of the Hebrew calendar, except that he specified three different epochs used by various Jewish communities being one, two, or three years later than the modern epoch.
If due to start on Monday, Wednesday or Friday it actually begins on the following day.
