While various religions and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through concepts such as theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their religions and who raise various objections to evolution.
However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation.
Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously.
Natural selection, including sexual selection, is the only known cause of adaptation but not the only known cause of evolution.
If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.
For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost.
Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature.
These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species.
In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence.
In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.
Such hybrids are generally infertile.
Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction.
For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids.
For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.
However, modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal gene transfer, this "tree of life" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species.
The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria.
The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon.
An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake.
Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as orthogenesis, evolutionism, and other beliefs about innate "progress" within the largest-scale trends in evolution, became obsolete scientific theories.
It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.
However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see Dollo's law).
In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes).
Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria.
Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species.
In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.
In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected Aristotle's approach.
"Nature" in this sense refers to an ecosystem, that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, physical as well as biological, in their local environment.
Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population.
This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.
Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil.
Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species.
Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.
(The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism.
The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.
A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype.
In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct.
For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass.
Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.
Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.
Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia.
The causes of the continuous "low-level" extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, may be the result of competition between species for limited resources (the competitive exclusion principle).
In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin formulated the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, published in his book ''On the Origin of Species'' (1859).
During evolution, some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures.
Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).
Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution.
Advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics, mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees.
The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.
These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support.
The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations.
However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.
As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage.
Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of kin selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.
'''·''' Graph 2 depicts stabilizing selection, where the intermediate phenotype is favored over the extreme traits.
Other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws.
The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.
These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the food chain and its geographic range.
Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species.
Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction.
Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information.
More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms.
The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.
It can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species.
These traits are said to be "selected ''for''."
Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved.
# ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats.
In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.
# An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.
The Biological Species Concept (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach.
The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype.
Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis.
Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from "reptile"-like lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, homininae around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250,000 years ago.
This teleonomy is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform.
Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow).
In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.
Although complex species have evolved, they occur as a side effect of the overall number of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in the biosphere.
Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.
If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles.
Speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.
Adaptations are produced by natural selection.
Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.
Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.
# ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.
When mutations occur, they may alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect.
In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution.
More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA.
These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates.
As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to "drift" upward or downward randomly (in a random walk).
About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals.
Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors.
The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's "transmutation" theory of 1809, which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents.
The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene.
Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer.
Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms.
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome.
In terms of practical application, an understanding of evolution has been instrumental to developments in numerous scientific and industrial fields, including agriculture, human and veterinary medicine, and the life sciences in general.
As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.
For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children.
Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive.
This activity is selected for because if the ''helping'' individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will ''also'' contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.
Partly influenced by ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'' (1798) by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished.
Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes, and this is called the species problem.
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation.
Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures.
In contrast to these materialistic views, Aristotle considered all natural things, not only living things, as being imperfect actualisations of different fixed natural possibilities, known as "forms," "ideas," or (in Latin translations) "''species''."
New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.
When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations.
Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland as well as "remains of biotic life" found  in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.
'''·''' Graph 1 shows directional selection, in which a single extreme phenotype is favored.
The third mechanism of speciation is parapatric speciation.
In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources.
According to one of the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe."
However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth.
Current species are a stage in the process of evolution, with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events.
These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct a biological "tree of life" based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils.
Simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of life on Earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life up to the present day, with complex life only appearing more diverse because it is more noticeable.
DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles.
In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.
Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.
One type of sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species to produce a new hybrid species.
The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilized multicellular organisms.
Other, nonadaptive evolutionary processes include mutation, genetic drift and gene migration.
Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value.
But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible.
Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.
Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation.
The most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration.
This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss.
This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.
Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or "filament").
Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA.
He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems.
Prokaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago.
Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions.
An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, termites and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce.
In contrast, the offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment.
The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance.
Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.
Repeated formation of new species (speciation), change within species (anagenesis), and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits, including shared DNA sequences.
In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education.
This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair.
Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity.
Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s.
In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J.
Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' case.
Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.
The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.
Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.
A common misconception is that evolution has goals, long-term plans, or an innate tendency for "progress," as expressed in beliefs such as orthogenesis and evolutionism; realistically however, evolution has no long-term goal and does not necessarily produce greater complexity.
Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland.
The comparative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current research.
If selection would favor either one out of two mutations, but there is no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population.
It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles.
For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common.
Most loss of function mutations are selected against.
Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century.
The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.
Their separate papers were presented together at a 1858 meeting of the Linnean Society of London.
Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection.
The publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.
Molecular biology improved our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.
Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.
Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.
All organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool.
These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution.
Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone.
The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork ''De rerum natura'' (''On the Nature of Things'').
Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.
However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important.
However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation).
This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.
For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution.
Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists.
The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions.
Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.
Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.
Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die.
Not all co-evolved interactions between species involve conflict.
This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium.
This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely.
Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system."
Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche, or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system.
Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation.
This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.
Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence.
The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism.
However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: structures originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process.
The neutral theory of molecular evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes are the result of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift.
Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.
In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.
This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.
This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.
DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.
The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size.
Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, as well as pharmaceutical drugs.
Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept.
More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.
Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."
In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations.
An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome.
