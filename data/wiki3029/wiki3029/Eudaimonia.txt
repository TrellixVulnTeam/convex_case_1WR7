A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity.
They tend to agree also that Plato’s earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato’s own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the ''Phaedo'' and the ''Republic.''
The intrinsic motivation approach of Viktor Frankl emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal.
As with all other ancient ethical thinkers Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else.
For a Greek, areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty.
Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby.
Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something.
The sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like "speed is a virtue in a horse", or "height is a virtue in a basketball player".
Thrasymachus’s views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the ''Gorgias'', through the mouthpiece of Callicles.
Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.
He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure, and also, freedom from pain and distress.
They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose.
On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘happiness is doing well and living well’.
Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction.
Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia.
So, a person who is hideously ugly or has “lost children or good friends through death” (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon.
These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent’s social environments.
Negative correlations have been found with indicators of psychological ill-being: negative affect, depression and anxiety.
But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality.
They use concepts such as ‘morally ought,’ ‘morally obligated,’ ‘morally right,’ and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of moral authority.
His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon.
Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we aren’t particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason.
Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with self-control, and in the facets of eudaimonia are heritable.
Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia.
In this way, "dumb luck" (chance) can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia.
The argument of the ''Republic'' is lengthy and complex.
Someone asks, “why do you want the money?” and you answer, “So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the Mediterranean, and a red Ferrari.” This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because it is a means to getting your apartment and red Ferrari.
To see this, consider the following example.
For example, when we say that someone is “a very happy person,” we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life.
It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction.
(This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of Nietzsche.)
Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation.
Virtues are states of the soul.
Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body?
Epicurus’ basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous.
The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires.
However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure.
In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.
However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia.
The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life.
Engagement and meaning orientations describe a pursuit of happiness that integrates two positive psychology constructs “flow/engagement” and “eudaimonia/meaning”.
For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills,  one might say "doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist".
Much more… (47e–48a)
So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not.
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.
Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment.
Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century.
Plato’s great work of the middle period, the ''Republic'', is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist Thrasymachus, that conventional morality, particularly the ‘virtue’ of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia.
The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves ‘mentor’ their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia.
The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.
Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage.
However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues.
# Terror management theory
Throughout the rest of the ''Republic'', Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the virtue of justice is necessary for eudaimonia.
It is instrumentally valuable: valuable only because of what one obtains by means of it.
A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy.
According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment.
Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success.
The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct their study.
Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends.
It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well.
As already noted, the Greek word areté is usually translated into English as '''virtue'''.
For example, in the ''Meno'', with respect to wisdom, he says: “… everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness…”''Meno'' 88c.
Individuals that strive for a life defined by affiliation, intimacy and contributing to one’s community can be described as aspiring to fulfil their intrinsic psychological needs.
Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).
This view is confirmed in the ''Crito'', where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:
It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.
What we know of Socrates' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato’s writings.
Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.
Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous.
By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.
Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing.
Basically, well being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are "the rational animal".
The study was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes.
According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires activity, action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition.
This can be illustrated in the words taken from the Discworld series by author Sir Terry Pratchett “…a man is not dead while his name is still spoken.”  Leaving a legacy serves to reduce the fear of death and increase self-esteem by living up to the ideals of society.
One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of consciousness.
Stoic philosophy begins with Zeno of Citium c.300 BC, and was developed by Cleanthes (331&ndash;232 BC) and Chrysippus (c.280–c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity.
In addition to psychological benefits, self-acceptance may have physical benefits as well.
To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood.
This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy).
Because of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness, some alternative translations have been proposed.
Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value.
However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e.
Aristotle’s account is articulated in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics.''
(see Plato, ''Apology'' 30b, ''Euthydemus'' 280d&ndash;282d, ''Meno'' 87d&ndash;89a).
In the ''Apology,'' Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.
One important difference between Epicurus’ eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness.
In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one’s experience of feeling happy may affect one’s eudaimonia.
She states that the pursuit and acquisition of positive relationships is an intrinsically motivated desire that is endorsed cross-culturally as a route to being void of ill-being as well as leading a meaningful life.
In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia.
But these are all objective judgments about someone’s life: they concern a person’s really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends.
Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree).
Anscombe's article ''Modern Moral Philosophy'' stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories.
We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by ''virtue'', which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty.
Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on.
Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision.
They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing ones “''daimon''” (daemon) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one’s true self.
For example, the results of a 2008 study propose that older women with higher levels of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance showed lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a marker for glucose levels/insulin resistance.
Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings.
31a&ndash;b; italics added
However, they disagree on the way in which this is so.
Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness.
Both of the latter orientations are also associated with aspiring to meet intrinsic needs for affiliation and community and were amalgamated by Anić and Tončić into a single “eudaimonic” path to happiness that elicited high scores on all measures of well-being and life satisfaction.
For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.
The self-control approach, as expounded by C. R. Snyder, focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success.
Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul 29e.
This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of Immanuel Kant, who argues that the possession of a "good will" is the only unconditional good.
Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance.
The questionnaire describes and differentiates individuals on the basis of three orientations to happiness which can be pursued, though some individuals do not pursue any.
From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason 1097b22&ndash;1098a20.
An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable.
The psychologist C. D. Ryff highlighted the distinction between ''eudaimonia wellbeing'', which she identified as psychological well-being, and ''hedonic wellbeing'' or pleasure.
As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed.
Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).
The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind’s Parent Behaviour Rating Interview.
One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant’s position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.
Aristotle’s ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue.
The candidates that he mentions are a (1) life of pleasure, (2) a life of political activity and (3) a philosophical life.
The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1099a5).
This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one’s behaviour’s values, and true-self.
The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well.
Scholars typically divide Plato’s works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods.
Suppose you spend your days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities, such as entering data into a computer, and this, all for money.
In contrast those individuals who aspire for wealth and material, social recognition, fame, image or attractiveness can be described as aiming to fulfil their extrinsic psychological needs.
The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.
Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.
'''Eudaimonia'''  (Greek: εὐδαιμονία ), sometimes anglicized as '''eudaemonia''' or '''eudemonia''' , is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, "human flourishing" has been proposed as a more accurate translation.
Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of “virtuous activity in accordance with reason” 1097b22&ndash;1098a20.
Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely ‘neutral’.
Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.)
Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions.
According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia.
So Socrates’ point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches.
It is a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, along with the terms "aretē", most often translated as "virtue" or "excellence", and "phronesis", often translated as "practical or ethical wisdom".
Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e.
Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains,  as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves.
They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, that they have a clearer image of themselves, what they want to achieve and higher wellness.
He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason.
She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the Ten Commandments depends on someone having made these rules.
As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism.
Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.
This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the ''Republic'' when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus’ challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges.
''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.
One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, "arete" ("virtue").
So, as Aristotle points out, saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable, and means living well, is not saying very much.
He believes that we  do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure.
Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity.
On Plato’s version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.
We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them.
So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (areté is bound up with eudaimonia).
Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them.
It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (''areté'') in reason.
In this, they are akin to Cynic philosophers such as Antisthenes and Diogenes in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one’s family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia.
Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism.
When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne.
(This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato’s earlier dialogues.)
The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them.
Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue.
Everyone wants to be eudaimon; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual’s well being.
The “pleasure” orientation describes a path to happiness that is associated with adopting hedonistic life goals to satisfy only one’s extrinsic needs.
Zeno believed happiness was a "good flow of life"; Cleanthes suggested it was "living in agreement with nature", and Chrysippus believed it was "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature."
This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle’s essentialist understanding of human nature, the view that reason (''logos'' sometimes translated as rationality) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (''ergon'') of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason.
The thrust of Glaucon’s challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim.
… it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for ''virtue''.
Building on Aristotelian ideals of belonging and benefiting others, flourishing, thriving and exercising excellence, she conceptualised eudaimonia as a six-factor structure :
Researchers focused their studies on PYD (positive youth development) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of 3 developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.
# Environmental mastery
Terror management theory was originally proposed in 1986 by Jeff Greenberg, Sheldon Solomon, and Tom Pyszczynski, based on the work of Ernest Becker in 1973.
Julia Driver in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains:
The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being.
It is much more valuable…?
Ross suggests "well-being" and John Cooper proposes "flourishing".
We shall consider the main theories in a moment, but first a warning about the proper translation of areté.
It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one’s soul, that one’s soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue.
Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.
And even Epicurus who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue.
The alternative translation '''excellence''' (or "a desirable quality") might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term.
By contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness.
Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life).
G. E. M. Anscombe in her article "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958) argued that duty-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a "law without a lawgiver".
Etymologically, it consists of the words "''eu''" ("good") and "''daimōn''" ("spirit").
Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good.
Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness.
The rest of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason.
Individuals were grouped according to their chosen paths/strategies to happiness as identified by their answers on an Orientation to Happiness Questionnaire.
Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism.
Importantly, she also produced scales for assessing mental health.
Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual’s (objective) well being.
While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other ‘goods’ such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic.
(His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.)
Positive correlations have been found with indications of psychological well-being: positive affect, vitality, and self-actualization.
Epicurus’ ethical theory is hedonistic.
drug and alcohol use).
Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach.
In Aristotle's works, eudaimonia was (based on older Greek tradition) used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.
Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child’s life.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one’s lifetime.
Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.
