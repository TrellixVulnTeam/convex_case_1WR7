# the half phase('''Karaṇa''', 1/60 synodic month)
A '''karaṇa''' is half of a '''tithi'''.
To be precise, a karaṇa is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6° starting from 0°.
, 5116 years have elapsed in the Hindu calendar.
The traditional Vedic calendar used to start with the month of agrahayan (agra=first + ayan = travel of the sun, equinox) or '''Mārgaśīṣa'''.
This is the month where the Sun crosses the equator, i.e.
The Bengali calendar (introduced 1584), is widely used in eastern India in the state of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam.
Another example is let's say when Pūrṇimā occurs in or near '''Viśākha nakṣatra''', this in turn results in the initiation of the lunar month titled '''Vaiśākha Māsa'''.
# the mansion('''Nakṣatra''' 1/27 condical month), about 251/27 hours.
The extra month is termed as "Adhik Mass" (extra month).
The subsequent Pakṣas will, for example, be:
# Kiṃstughna (किंस्तुघ्न)
In the Hindu calendar, the day is the time between the sunrises.
Names of months are interesting.
This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months.
This month was called mārgashirsha after the fifth nakshatra (around lambda orionis).
# Taitila or Taitula (तैतिल)
Another little-known difference between the two calendars exists: while each month in the ''Shalivahana'' calendar begins with the 'bright half' and is followed by the 'dark half', the opposite obtains in the ''Vikrama'' calendar.
*# If there is a '''Chaitra-Vaiśākha Kṣaya Śukla-Pakṣa''':
The Shalivahana calendar begins with the month of ''Chaitra'' (March) and the Ugadi/Gudi Padwa festivals mark the new year.
Chaitra month is when full moon is in Citrā nakṣatra , Ashvin month is when full moon is in Aśvinī nakṣatra
The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0° to 360° (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360).
But there are only 11 such karaṇas which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis.
This definition leads to a lot of complications:
This system contains a concept of leap years similar to the Julian calendar .
*# adhika Kārtika Śukla-Pakṣa
Similarly, for the ''nakṣatras'' ''Viśākha'', ''Jyeṣṭhā'', ''(Pūrva) Āṣāḍhā'', ''Śravaṇa'', ''Bhādrapadā'', ''Aśvinī'' (old name ''Aśvayuj''), ''Kṛttikā'', ''Mṛgaśiras'', ''Puṣya'', ''Meghā'' and ''(Pūrva/Uttara) Phalguṇī'' the names ''Vaiśākha'' etc.
The astronomical foundations were further developed in the medieval period, notably by  Bhāskara II (12th century).
For example, if a lunar month elapsed without a solar transit and the next transit is into ''Meṣa'', then this month without transit is labelled ''Adhika Chaitra Māsa''.
at pūrṇimā, the other lunar names are derived subsequently.
Due to the precession of the Earth's axis, the vernal equinox is now in Pisces, and corresponds to the month of chaitra.
The Indian national calendar or "Saka calendar" was introduced in 1957 based on the traditional Hindu calendars.
* The considerations for the new year are:
The epoch (starting point or first day of the zeroth year) of the current era of Hindu calendar (both solar and lunisolar) is 18 February 3102 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar or 23 January 3102 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
Lunar MonthCandra Māsa
After that, each year is labelled by the number of years '''elapsed''' since the epoch.
There is considered to be a "loss" because in this case, there is only one month labelled by both transits.
Thus, each month of the ''Shalivahana'' calendar ends with the no-moon day and the new month begins on the day after that, while the full-moon day brings each month of the ''Vikrama'' calendar to a close (This is an exception in Gujarati calendar, its month (and hence new year) starts on a sunrise of the day after new moon, and ends on the new moon, though it follows Vikram Samvat).
However, if the second month is ''āshvayuja kshaya'' then the festival will be observed in the first '''adhika''' month itself.
It features a constant number of days in every month (with leap years).
A month-long fair is celebrated in Machhegaun during '''adhika māsa'''.
There will be no separate months labelled ''Chaitra'' and ''Vaiśākha''.
If there's no zodiac enters a month, the month is an extra month.
* The '''Śukla Pakṣa''' of a given month, say '''Chaitra''', comprises the same actual days in both systems, as can be deduced from a careful analysis of the rules.
Twelve Hindu mas (māsa) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the sun passes through the sidereal zodiac in 365 1/4 days.
A month contains two halves(pakṣas), the waxing half and the waning half.
15 January through 12 February were ''Pauṣa-Māgha kṣaya-māsa''.
The 7 "repeating" karaṇas are:
If in the ''amānta'' system there is a '''Pauṣa-Māgha Kṣaya Māsa''', then in the ''pūrnimānta'' system there will be the following pakṣas:
The ages follow a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span and emotional and physical strength.
The Indian Calendar Reform Committee, appointed in 1952, identified more than thirty well-developed calendars, all variants of the ''Surya Siddhanta'' calendar outlined here, in systematic use across different parts of India.
An explanation of the terms follows.
There are 12 ''rāśi'' names, there are twelve lunar month names.
There're five "''concepts''" (''aṅgas'').
According to the Purāṇas this was the moment when Śrī Kṛṣṇa returned to his eternal abode.
(Compare with the definition of a tithi.)
These include the widespread ''Vikrama'' and ''Shalivahana'' calendars and regional variations thereof.
A few are based on the solar cycle, Sankranti (solar sidereal) and Baisakhi (solar tropical).
If there is no solar transit in one lunar month but there are two transits in the next lunar month,
This shift over the years is what has led to various calendar reforms in different regions to assert different months as the start month for the year.
* If there is an ''adhika Chaitra'', then it will follow the ''(nija) Chaitra Krṣṇa-Pakṣa'' at the end of the year.
* Next, the 7-repeating karaṇas repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-''tithis''.
Extra Month, or ''adhika māsa'' (māsa = lunar month in this context) is also known as puruśottama māsa, it is said that the name has been given by Lord Vishnu as his name to this month.
The term '''-vāsara''' is often realised as '''vāra''' or '''vaar''' in Sanskrit-derived and influenced languages.
This extra month is called Mala Masa (impure month) in eastern India.
Thus these are also "fixed" (sthira).
This is been done for bridging of the lunar and solar calendars
Others may start with '''Vaiśākha''' (e.g.
The Tamil calendar, a solar calendar, is used in Tamil Nadu and Kollavarsham calendar is used in Kerala.
Regional diversification took place in the medieval period.
* Though the regular months are defined by the full moon, the ''adhika'' and '''kṣaya''' lunar months are still defined by the new moon.
Thus, some calendars (e.g.
Most systems use the current ordinal number of the year as the year label.
Having the two active traditions in practice would also mean that while the month names of the Hindu lunar calendar remains the same, there is on an average 15 days' difference in starting and ending of the month between the two traditions.
First one computes the angular distance along the ecliptic of each object, taking the ecliptic to start at ''Meṣa'' or Aries ('''Meṣādi''', as defined above): this is called the longitude of that object.
This official calendar follows the ''Shalivahan Shak'' calendar in beginning from the month of ''Chaitra'' and counting years with AD 78 being year zero.
The shift in the vernal equinox by nearly four months from '''Agrahāyaṇa''' to '''Chaitra''' in sidereal terms seems to indicate that the original naming conventions may date to the fourth or fifth millennium BCE, since the period of precession in the Earth's axis is about 25,800 years.
That means, if a festival should fall on the 10th ''tithi'' of the ''Āshvayuja'' month (this is called Vijayadashamī) and there are two '''Āśvayuja (Āśvina)''' months caused by the existence of an '''adhika Āśvayuja'', the first '''adhika''' month will not see the festival, and the festival will be observed only in the second ''nija'' month.
The most widely used authoritative text for the Hindu calendars is the "Sūrya Siddhānta", a text of uncertain age, though some place it at 10th century.
*# nija Śrāvaṇa Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa
But just as a person's true age is measured by the number of years that have elapsed starting from the date of the person's birth, the Hindu calendar measures the number of years elapsed.
'''Special Case:'''
This month is called ''Chaitra''.
Parallel months and roughly the same periods apply to the Buddhist calendars used in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
It is also counted on a daily basis.
Purshottam maas is an extra month or thirteen in the Hindu calendar.
6 December onwards was '''Pauṣa'''.
There are actually 4 "fixed" (sthira) karaṇas and 7 "repeating" (cara) karaṇas.
The phase decides the date of the day from the sunrise in the phase.
This tradition is chiefly followed in the northern and eastern states of India (Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh).
Again, minor variations may exist.
Together 5 limbs or properties are labelled under as the ''pañcāṅgas'' (Sanskrit: ''pañca'' = five).
When the sun transits into the ''Meṣa rāśi'' in a lunar month, then the name of the lunar month is ''Chaitra ''which has both ''Mīna rāśi'' and ''Meṣa rāśi ''.
This is a very very rare occurrence.
*# Pauṣa-Maagha kshaya Śukla-Pakṣa
Both the ''Vikrama'' and the ''Shalivahana'' are lunisolar calendars, and feature annual cycles of twelve lunar months, each month divided into two phases: the 'bright half' ('''Śukla Pakṣa''') and the 'dark half' ('''Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa'''); these correspond respectively to the periods of the 'waxing' and the 'waning' of the moon.
Among normal months, ''adhika'' months, and ''kshaya'' months, the earlier are considered "better" for religious purposes.
Most holidays in India are based on the first two calendars.
This sum is divided into 27 parts.

The Sanskrit derivation of the lunar month names ''Chaitra'' etc.
That is, the Mahāśivarātri, defined in the ''amānta māna'' to be observed on the fourteenth of the ''Māgha krishna paksha'' will now (in the ''pūrnimānta māna'') be defined by the ''Phālguna krishna paksha''.
There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.
Most of the Hindu calendars derived from Gupta era astronomy as developed by Āryabhaṭa and  Varāhamihira in the 5th to 6th century.
It is general belief that one can wash away all one's sins by taking a bath in the Machhenarayan's pond.

In the animation above, Year 2 illustrates this concept with Bhadrapada repeating; the first time the Sun stays entirely within Simha rashi thus resulting in an Adhika Bhadrapada.

That is, even if the '''pūrnimānta''' system is followed, ''adhika'' or '''kṣaya''' months will start with the first sunrise after the new moon, and end with the new moon.
# Vava or Bava (बव)
* Now the first half of the 1st ''tithi'' (of Śukla Pakṣa) is always '''Kiṃtughna karaṇa''.
These parts are called the ''yogas''.
*## if an ''''' precedes it, then the 'adhika Chaitra Śukla-Pakṣa'' starts the new year
# '''Phālguna Māsa''' is the last lunar month, with the last pakṣa of the year in this '''pūrṇimānta''' system being '''Phālguna Śukla-Pakṣa'''.
* The new year is still on the first day of the ''Chaitra Śukla-Pakṣa''.
However, the lunisolar calendar year usually starts earlier than the solar calendar year, so the exact year will not begin on the same day every year.
If the sun transits into '''two''' ''rāshis'' within a lunar month, then the month will have to be labelled by both transits and will take the epithet ''kṣaya'' or "loss".
A variant of the ''Shalivahana'' calendar was reformed and standardised as the Indian National calendar in 1957.
* The '''adhika''' month will therefore get sandwiched between the 2 pakṣas of the ''nija'' months.
Purnimant tradition, on the other hand, considers the next day of a full moon to be the first day of the lunar month.
Brahmā lives for 100 years of 360 "days" and at the end, he is said to dissolve, along with his entire Creation, into the Eternal Soul or ''Paramātman''.
In this case, the end of the lunar month will coincide with a full moon.
A '''Kṣaya-Māsa''' occurs very rarely.
For example, if the sun transits into ''Meṣa'' and ''Vṛṣabha'' in a lunar month, then it will be called ''Chaitra-Vaiśākha kṣaya-māsa''.
The (6) '''Vedāṅgas''' (auto Veda) called '''Jyotiṣa''' (literally, "celestial body study") prescribed all the aspects of the Hindu calendars.
This has its effects in the dates of recurring annual events such as the holy month of Śrāvaṇa.
However, none of these above complications cause a change in the day of religious observances.
If the sun had transited into only one ''raashi'' in a lunar month as is usual, there would have been two separate months labelled by the two transits in question.
For example, a ''Śrāvaṇa Adhika Māsa'' will be inserted as follows:
the vernal equinox.
If there's no sunrise in a phase, the phase is a vancant date.
In the Vikrama calendar, the zero year corresponds to 56 BC, while in the Shalivahana calendar, it corresponds to AD 78.
# Viṣṭi (Bhadra) (भद्रा)
The Dvāpara, Tretā, and Kṛta Yugas are two, three, and four times the length of the Kali Yuga, respectively.
6 November to 5 December were '''Kārtika-Mārgaśīrṣa Kṣaya-Māsa'''.
A reformation of this calendar was introduced in present-day Bangladesh in 1966, with constant days in each month and a leap year system; this serves as the national calendar for Bangladesh.
The names of the 12 months, as also their sequence, are the same in both calendars; however, the new year is celebrated at separate points during the year and the "year zero" for the two calendars is different.
Thus these are the "repeating" (cara) karaṇas.
When a full moon (instead of new moon) occurs before sunrise on a day, that day is said to be the first day of the lunar month.
Both the solar and lunisolar calendars started on this date.
The Vedic day begins at sunrise.
When two months are rolled into one in the case of a ''kshaya māsa'', the festivals of both months will also be rolled into this '''Kṣaya Māsa'''', unless "adhika māsa" precedes it.
There are many references to calendrics in the Vedas.
This is called the '''pūrṇimānta māna''' - '''full-moon-ending reckoning''', as against the '''amānta māna''' - '''new-moon-ending reckoning''' used before.
For example, the festival of '''Mahāshivarātri''' which is to be observed on the fourteenth '''tithi''' of the '''Māgha Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa''' was, in 1983, observed on the corresponding ''tithi'' of '''Pauṣa-Māgha Kṣaya Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa''', since in that year, '''Pauṣa''' and '''Māgha''' were rolled into one, and nija margashirsha preceded it, as mentioned above.
Vikram) start with Chaitra, which is the present-day month of the vernal equinox, as the first month.
There are two traditions being followed with respect to the start of the month.
There are two different systems for making the lunar calendar:
When the sun transits into ''Vṛṣabha ''rāśi'','' then the lunar month is ''Vaiśākha ''which has both ''Meṣa rāśi and Vṛṣabha rāśi''.
*# Māgaśīrsa-Pauṣa Kṣaya Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa
* ''Pūrṇimānta'' or ''gauna mana system'' – a month begins with a full moon and ends at full moon(the waxing half follows the waning half), followed more in north India.
This means that that many days have passed in the present Kaliyuga (1/10 of Catur-Yugas total).
* The '''kṣaya''' month is more complicated.
After the Vedic period, there were many scholars such as Āryabhaṭa (5th century), Varāhamihira (6th century) and Bhāskara (12th century) who were expert scholars in '''Jyotiṣa''' and contributed to the development of the Hindu calendar.
*# Kārtika-Māgaśīrṣa Kṣaya Śukla-Pakṣa
* The special '''Kṣaya''' case where an ''adhika māsa'' precedes a ''kshaya māsa'' gets even more convoluted.
However, the Chaitra Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣas defined by the 2 systems will be on different days, since the Chaitra Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa precedes the Chaitra Śukla-Pakṣa in the ''pūrnimānta'' system but follows it in the ''amānta'' system.
First, we should remember that the ''Āśvina Śukla-Pakṣa'' is the same in both the systems.
The Kali Yuga began approximately five thousand years ago, and it has a duration of 432,000 years.
These in turn were based in the astronomical tradition of  ''Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa'', which in the preceding centuries had been standardised in a number of (non-extant) works known as  ''Sūrya Siddhānta''.
*# nija Kārtika Kṛṣṇa-Pakṣa
The Vikrama calendar begins with the month of '''Baiśākha''' or '''Vaiśākha''' (April), or ''Kartak'' (October/November) in Gujarat.
They are often translated into English as the Golden, Silver, Bronze and Iron Ages, respectively.
The last was in 1315.
Beginning from 1 on the first day, it has presently reached over 1864000 days.
It depends on the aster-ism name, the moon is in at full moon day of the month.

Differences and regional variations abound in these computations, but the following is a general overview of the Hindu lunisolar calendar.

The next month will be labelled according to its transit as usual and will get the epithet ''nija'' ("original") or ''Śuddha'' ("unmixed").
The starting point is Meshadi or Mesha Sankranti, (1st day of Meṣa or the Hindu solar new year).
In the year 56 BC, Vikrama Samvat era was founded by the emperor Vikramaditya of Ujjain following his victory over the Sakas.
Later, in a similar fashion, Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni initiated the Saka era to celebrate his victory against the Sakas in the year AD 78.
Known gaps between occurrence of Kṣaya-Māsas are 19 and 141 years.
The Hindu calendar descends from the Vedic times.
Each part will now equal 800' (where ' is the symbol of the arcminute which means 1/60 of a degree).
Hence this '''karaṇa''' is "fixed".
# Gara or Garaja (गरज)
The two calendars most widely used today are the ''Vikrama'' calendar which is followed in  Nepal as national calendar and also in the Indian regions like western and northern India and the Shalivahana or ''Saka'' calendar which is followed in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa.
*## if not, the '''Kṣaya Śukla-Pakṣa''' starts the new year

The ''yoga'' that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing ''yoga'' for the day.
If the there're two sunrise in a phase, the second day is an extra day.
This is an unusual feature of the Hindu calendar.
In Gujarat, Diwali is held on the final day of the Vikram calendar and the next day marks the beginning of the New Year and is also referred as ‘Annakut’ or Nutan Varsh or Bestu Varash.
