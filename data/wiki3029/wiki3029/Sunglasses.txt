"Teashades" was also used to describe glasses worn to hide the effects of recreational drugs such as marijuana (conjunctival injection) or heroin (pupillary constriction) or just bloodshot eyes.
This step opened the European market to Australian-made sunglasses, but the standard also maintained requirements considered specific to Australia's climate.
Optimierter Lichtschutz der Augen.
In all cases, hiding one's eyes has implications for nonverbal communication; this is useful in poker, and many professional poker players wear heavily tinted glasses indoors while playing, so that it is more difficult for opponents to read tells which involve eye movement and thus gain an advantage.
The stereotype persisted long after improvements in film quality and the introduction of ultraviolet filters had eliminated this problem.
Since 2002 NASA uses the frame of the designer model ''Titan Minimal Art'' of the Austrian company Silhouette, combined with specially dark lenses developed jointly by the company and "the" NASA optometrist Keith Manuel.
People with small noses may need sunglasses with high nose bridges to allow clearance.
* Category 1 - 43%-80% transmission - low sun exposure
Materials such as bamboo, ebony, rosewood, pear wood, walnut and zebrawood, are used making them non-toxic and nearly allergy free.
Graduated lenses, with the bottom part lighter than the top, can make it easier to see the controls within the car.
With wooden sunglasses, various shades of brown, beige, burgundy or black are most common.
In rare cases, lenses can filter out too much blue light (i.e., 100%), which affects color vision and can be dangerous in traffic when colored signals are not properly recognized.
They can make eye contact impossible, which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer's detachment, which is considered desirable (or "cool") in some circles.
An alternative are flip-up glasses.
Protection from the Sun's rays was not a concern for him.
Analogous to Inuit goggles (see above), the principle is not to filter light, but to decrease the amount of sun rays falling into the wearer's eyes.
As a backlash against 80s fashion occurred in the 1990s, wraparounds became one of the favorite frames of the decade.
An alternative are clip-on glasses.
However, these sunglasses are usually more expensive than the conventional plastic, acetate or metal frames and require more care.
The model saw more limited use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, aided by a 1982 product placement deal, featured most notably in ''Top Gun'' and ''Cobra'', with both films causing a 40% rise in 1986.
This can be true for people with severe visual impairment, such as the blind, who may wear sunglasses to avoid making others uncomfortable.
The lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces such as water.

In the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among stars of movies.
Sunglasses of this type are sometimes called mirrorshades.
In some cases, this connection serves as the core concept behind an entire brand.
To protect against "stray light" from the sides, the lenses should fit close enough to the temples and/or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders.
Frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles cannot become dislodged, then float and be inhaled.
Photochromic lenses gradually darken when exposed to ultraviolet light.
The current standard EN 1836:2005 was preceded by the older standards EN 166:1995 (Personal eye protection –Specifications), EN167: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Optical test methods), and EN168: 1995 (Personal eye protection – Non-optical test methods), which in 2002 were republished as a revised standard under the name of EN 1836:1997 (which included two amendments).
The assumption is that it may be more comfortable for another person not to see the hidden eyes rather than see abnormal eyes or eyes which seem to look in the wrong direction.
This makes them unsuitable for driving because car windscreens filter out UV light, which both slows and limits the reaction of the lenses; they could become too dark or too light for the conditions.
The most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as photokeratitis, snow blindness, cataracts, pterygium, and various forms of eye cancer.
Shutter Shades were invented in the late 1940s, became a fad in the early 1980s and has experienced a revival in the early-to-mid 2010s.
This is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the European Union (see below), which requires that 95% of the radiation up to only 380&nbsp;nm must be reflected or filtered out.
The reasons are that the cost of a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses, and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses.
For example, a gray lens can have a blue mirror coating, and a brown lens can have a silver coating.
Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929.
Mirrored lenses, having a metallic, partially reflective coating on the outer surface, combined with a tinted glass lens, are an alternative to polarization for UV protection, improving contrast when depth perception is important such as seeing moguls and ice while skiing or snowboarding.
* Category 2 - 18%-43% transmission - medium sun exposure
Sunglasses sold in the United States are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and are required to conform to safety standards.
Some brands have experimented with recycled wood from objects like skateboards, whiskey barrels and baseball bats.
There are three common styles: full frame, half frame, and frameless.
Modern versions tend to have plastic lenses, as do many other sunglasses.
Sunglass lenses are made of either glass, plastic, or SR-91.
The U.S. standard is ANSI Z80.3-2001, which includes three transmittance categories.
Some manufacturers already design to block blue light; the insurance company Suva, which covers most Swiss employees, asked eye experts around Charlotte Remé (ETH Zürich) to develop norms for blue blocking, leading to a recommended minimum of 95% of the blue light.Remé, Charlotte (1997).
Oversized sunglasses, because of their larger frames and lenses, are useful for individuals who are trying to minimize the apparent size or arch of their nose.
Optimized protection from light-inflicted eye damage.
Oversized sunglasses also offer more protection from sunburn due to the larger areas of skin they cover, although sunblock should still be used.
The European standard EN 1836:2005 has four transmittance ratings: "0" for insufficient UV protection, "2" for sufficient UHV protection, "6" for good UHV protection and "7" for "full" UHVV protection, meaning that no more than 5% of the 380&nbsp;nm rays are transmitted.
'', deserts, mountains, and fluorescent-lighted offices, and the technology was commercially marketed by a U.S. company.
the United States) and recommended by experts.
To provide UV protection, Shutter Shades sometimes use lenses in addition to the shutters; if not, they provide very insufficient protection against ultraviolet radiation and blue light.
When driving a vehicle, particularly at high speed, dazzling glare caused by a low sun, or by lights reflecting off snow, puddles, other vehicles, or even the front of the vehicle, can be lethal.

Blue-blocking tinted glasses, i.e.
An anti-reflection coating is recommended, and a hard coating to protect the lenses from scratches.
The modern variant surged in the mid-1980s, heavily based on the then-popular Wayfarer, but adapting it to a more futuristic look.
While some blue blocking sunglasses (see above) are produced as regular sunglasses for exposure to bright sunlight, others—especially for macular degeneration patients—do not block light or other colors in order to function well in regular daylight and even dim sunlight.
In addition to the features for sports glasses, water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off, and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging.
The purpose is to allow the wearer to easily change lenses when light conditions or activities change.
In addition to filtering, the standard also lists requirements for minimum robustness, labeling, materials (non-toxic for skin contact and not combustible) and lack of protrusions (to avoid harm when wearing them).
Mirrored coatings can be made any color by the manufacturer for styling and fashion purposes.
There has been some speculation that sunglasses actually promote skin cancer.
For water sports, so-called water sunglasses (also: surf goggles or water eyewear) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water, such as the surf or whitewater.
Even though some of these glasses are proven good enough for driving at night, it is strongly recommended not to do so, due to the changes in a wide variety of light intensities, especially while using yellow tinted protection glasses.
Regarding blue light, the color gives at least a first indication: Blue blocking lenses are commonly yellow or brown whereas blue or gray lenses cannot offer the necessary blue light protection.
Shwood, for example have experimented with these materials, they have even used recycled newspaper to manufacture frames.
Plastic lenses are lighter and shatter-resistant, but are more prone to scratching.
Popular glasses for this use are a type called '''glacier glasses''' or '''glacier goggles'''.
The term has now fallen into disuse, although references can still be found in literature of the time.
The relevance of sunglasses within the fashion industry has included prominent fashion editors' reviews of annual trends in sunglasses as well as runway fashion shows featuring sunglasses as a primary or secondary component of a look.
Yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease.
Many of the criteria for sunglasses worn when piloting an aircraft are similar to those for land vehicles.
The lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little "stray light" can reach the eye from their sides, or from above or below, but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses.
Inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses (or wearing no sunglasses at all) because they provoke the pupil to open wider.
An alternative is to use the corrective glasses with a secondary lenses such as oversize sunglasses that fit over the regular glasses, clip-on lens that are placed in front of the glasses, and flip-up glasses which feature a dark lens that can be flipped up when not in use (see below).
People may also wear sunglasses to hide dilated or contracted pupils, bloodshot eyes due to drug use, chronic dark circles or crow's feet, recent physical abuse (such as a black eye), exophthalmos (bulging eyes), a cataract, or eyes which jerk uncontrollably (nystagmus).

In recent years, manufacturers have started to use various types of woods to make frames for sunglasses.
to protect the eyes from ultraviolet radiation (UV) and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems.
It is commonly believed that this was to avoid recognition by fans, but an alternative reason sometimes given is that they often had red eyes from the powerful arc lamps that were needed due to the extremely slow speed film stocks used.
The main purpose of these glasses are to protect the wearer from dust and smog particles entering into the eyes while driving at high speeds.
Polarised lenses normally have a fixed tint, and can reduce reflected glare more than non-polarised lenses of the same density, particularly on wet roads.
NASA research primarily by scientists James B. Stephens and Charles G. Miller at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) resulted in special lenses that protected against the light in space and during laser and welding work.
Variable tint or photochromic lenses increase their optical density when exposed to UV light, reverting to their clear state when the UV brightness decreases.
The glasses continue to be popular with women, and celebrities may use them, ostensibly to hide from paparazzi.
Aviators became popular again around 2000, as the hippie movement experienced a brief revival, and was prominently featured in the MTV show ''Jackass''.

Frames can be made to hold the lenses in several different ways.
Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection.

Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach to the top of the lenses and on the side near the top.
Polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised, intentionally or unintentionally, showing Moiré patterns on looking through the windscreen; and some LCDs used by instruments emit polarised light, and can dim or disappear when the pilot turns to look at them.
Instead of tinted lenses, they decrease sun exposure by means of a set of parallel, horizontal shutters (like a small window shutter).
They must be flexible and durable, and must fit firmly in zero-gravity.
They allow wearers to see into water when only surface glare would otherwise be seen, and eliminate glare from a road surface when driving into the sun.
This mirrored coating deflects some of the light when it hits the lens so that it is not transmitted through the lens, making it useful in bright conditions; however, it does not necessarily reflect UV radiation as well.
However, it was in the late 1960s when the frames became widely used with the rise of the hippie counterculture, which preferred large metallic sunglasses.
Special shaded visors were once allowed in American football; Jim McMahon, quarterback for the Chicago Bears and San Diego Chargers, famously used a sun visor during his professional football career due to a childhood eye injury and almost always wears dark sunglasses when not wearing a football helmet.

Since the early 1980s, makers have also developed variants of the model, most notably the Clubmaster model, introduced in 1982, essentially Browlines made of plastic.
90% of astronauts wear glasses in space, even if they do not require corrective glasses on Earth, because zero-gravity and pressure changes temporarily affect their vision.
More recently, high-energy visible light (HEV) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration;Margrain TH, Boulton M, Marshall J, Sliney DH.
People may also wear sunglasses to hide an abnormal appearance of their eyes.

Lenses of fixed tint are graded according to the optical density of the tint; in the UK sunglasses must be labelled and show the filter category number.
They typically have very dark round lenses and leather blinders at the sides, which protect the eyes by blocking the Sun's rays around the edges of the lenses.
Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses.
Depending on the manufacturing technology, sufficiently protective lenses can block much or little light, resulting in dark or light lenses.

The following types are not all mutually exclusive; glasses may be in Aviator style with mirrored lenses, for example.
amber or yellow, are sometimes recommended to treat insomnia; they are worn in artificial lighting after dark, to reestablish the circadian rhythm.
Mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection, because sunlight (including ultraviolet radiation) is more intense in higher altitudes, and snow and ice reflect additional light.
These were first made in the 1960s as variants of the Aviator model, used by Yoko Ono and Clint Eastwood in the ''Dirty Harry'' films.

Additionally, it was the first to combine this passing score with the highest marks for lens clarity.
Nose bridges provide support between the lens and the face.
A 1995 study reported that "Expensive brands and polarizing sunglasses do not guarantee optimal UVA protection."
People with medium noses may need a low or medium nose bridge.
1980s nostalgia and the influence of the hipster subculture and the television series ''Mad Men'' boosted Wayfarers once again after a slump in the 1990s and 2000s, also aided by a 2000 redesign (''New Wayfarer''), surpassing Aviators since 2012.
The most common type of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses has a single lens or shield that covers both eyes.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also reported that "consumers cannot rely on price as an indicator of quality".
It also allows easy replacement of a set of lenses if they are damaged.
It is not possible to "see" the protection that sunglasses offer.
To pass both tests, no part of the lens may touch the eye.
Lawbreakers have been known to wear sunglasses during or after committing a crime as an aid to hiding their identities.
Reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits: once inside the spacesuit, slipped glasses cannot be touched to push them back into place, sometimes for up to ten hours.
Part 1 Safety Requirements and Part 2 Performance Requirements), which was superseded in part in 2003 by AS/NZS 1067:2003 Sunglasses and fashion spectacles.
The five ratings for transmittance (filter) under this standard are based on the amount of absorbed light, 0 to 4, with "0" providing some protection from UV radiation and sunglare, and "4" indicating a high level of protection, but not to be worn when driving.
By 1938 ''Life'' magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a "new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S." It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes.
