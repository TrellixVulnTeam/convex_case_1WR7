In 1454 he mediated negotiations between Poland's Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki and the Prussian cities for repayment of war loans.
During the ensuing Thirteen Years' War (1454–66), he actively supported the Prussian cities' war effort with substantial monetary subsidies (only part of which he later re-claimed), with political activity in Toruń and Danzig, and by personally fighting in battles at Łasin (Lessen) and Malbork (Marienburg).
Copernicus conducted astronomical observations in 1513–16 presumably from his external curia; and in 1522–43, from an unidentified "small tower" (''turricula''), using primitive instruments modeled on ancient ones—the quadrant, triquetrum, armillary sphere.
Their contacts in this matter in the period of the Fifth Lateran Council were later memorialized in a complimentary mention in Copernicus's dedicatory epistle in ''Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' and in a treatise by Paul of Middelburg, ''Secundum compendium correctionis Calendarii'' (1516), which mentions Copernicus among the learned men who had sent the Council proposals for the calendar's emendation.
In the 14th century, members of the family began moving to various other Silesian cities, to the Polish capital, Kraków (1367), and to Toruń (1400).
Emulating the rationalistic style of Thomas Aquinas, Tolosani sought to refute Copernicanism by philosophical argument.
The find came after a year of searching, and the discovery was announced only after further research, on 3 November 2008.
Dariusz Zajdel of the Polish Police Central Forensic Laboratory used the skull to reconstruct a face that closely resembled the features—including a broken nose and a scar above the left eye—on a Copernicus self-portrait.
Arthur Koestler, in his popular book ''The Sleepwalkers'', asserted that Copernicus's book had not been widely read on its first publication.
Tolosani wrote:  "By means of these words of the ''Ad Lectorem'', the foolishness of this book's author is rebuked.
Luther is said to have remarked "So it goes now.
The father, Mikołaj the Elder, likely the son of Jan, came from the Kraków line.
From the beginning of 1504, Copernicus accompanied Watzenrode to sessions of the Royal Prussian diet held at Malbork and Elbląg and, write Dobrzycki and Hajdukiewicz, "participated... in all the more important events in the complex diplomatic game that ambitious politician and statesman played in defense of the particular interests of Prussia and Warmia, between hostility to the Teutonic Order and loyalty to the Polish Crown."
Further mathematical details of Aristarchus' heliocentric system were worked out around 150 BC by the Hellenistic astronomer Seleucus of Seleucia.
In it he formulated an early iteration of the theory, now called Gresham's law, that "bad" (debased) coinage drives "good" (un-debased) coinage out of circulation—several decades before Thomas Gresham.
Despite having been granted a papal indult on 29 November 1508 to receive further benefices, through his ecclesiastic career Copernicus not only did not acquire further prebends and higher stations (prelacies) at the chapter, but in 1538 he relinquished the Wrocław sinecure.
For by a foolish effort he Copernicus tried to revive the weak Pythagorean opinion that the element of fire was at the center of the Universe, long ago deservedly destroyed, since it is expressly contrary to human reason and also opposes holy writ.
Having settled permanently at Frombork, where he would reside to the end of his life, with interruptions in 1516–19 and 1520–21, Copernicus found himself at the Warmia chapter's economic and administrative center, which was also one of Warmia's two chief centers of political life.
They are of three kinds—"moral," offering advice on how people should live; "pastoral", giving little pictures of shepherd life; and "amorous", comprising love poems.
A black granite tombstone now identifies him as the founder of the heliocentric theory and also a church canon.
In his 12 April 1615 letter to a Catholic defender of Copernicus, Paolo Antonio Foscarini, Catholic Cardinal Robert Bellarmine condemned Copernican theory, writing "...not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world...Nor can one answer that this is not a matter of faith, since if it is not a matter of faith 'as regards the topic,' it is a matter of faith 'as regards the speaker': and so it would be heretical to say that Abraham did not have two children and Jacob twelve, as well as to say that Christ was not born of a virgin, because both are said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of prophets and apostles."
He made only a very few manuscript copies available to his closest acquaintances, including, it seems, several Kraków astronomers with whom he collaborated in 1515–30 in observing eclipses.
The intellectual climate of the time "remained dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and the corresponding Ptolemaic astronomy.
By what means could it maintain itself unmoved, while the heavens above are in constant rapid motion, did not its Divine Maker fix and establish it."
Furthermore, although the Council speaks about matters of faith and morals, nevertheless it cannot be denied that the Holy Fathers would be displeased with an interpretation of Sacred Scriptures which is contrary to their common agreement."
In treating such important patients, he sometimes sought consultations from other physicians, including the physician to Duke Albert and, by letter, the Polish Royal Physician.
He was a polyglot and polymath who obtained a doctorate in canon law and also practiced as a physician, classics scholar, translator, governor, diplomat, and economist.
In his younger days, Copernicus the physician had treated his uncle, brother and other chapter members.
However, according to French philosopher Alexandre Koyré, Copernicus's registration with the ''Natio Germanorum'' does not in itself imply that Copernicus considered himself German, since students from Prussia and Silesia were routinely so categorized, which carried certain privileges that made it a natural choice for German-speaking students, regardless of their ethnicity or self-identification.
Even though subtle experts institute many investigations for the sake of exercising their ingenuity, nevertheless public proclamation of absurd opinions is indecent and sets a harmful example."
On 14 July 2009, the discoverers, from the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany, of chemical element 112 (temporarily named ununbium) proposed to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that its permanent name be "copernicium" (symbol Cn).
Rheticus' hopes were dashed when six years after the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'' Melanchthon published his ''Initia Doctrinae Physicae'' presenting three grounds to reject Copernicanism.
Some time before 1514, Copernicus wrote an initial outline of his heliocentric theory known only from later transcripts, by the title (perhaps given to it by a copyist), ''Nicolai Copernici de hypothesibus motuum coelestium a se constitutis commentariolus''—commonly referred to as the ''Commentariolus''.
His denunciation of Copernicanism was written a year later, in 1545, in an appendix to his unpublished work, ''On the Truth of Sacred Scripture''.
In 1510 or 1512 Copernicus moved to Frombork, a town to the northwest at the Vistula Lagoon on the Baltic Sea coast.
Gingerich published his conclusions in 2004 in ''The Book Nobody Read''.
Other arguments for German being Copernicus's native tongue are that he was born in a predominantly German-speaking city and that, while studying canon law at Bologna in 1496, he signed into the German ''natio'' (''Natio Germanorum'')—a student organization which, according to its 1497 by-laws, was open to students of all kingdoms and states whose mother-tongue was German.
Though Aristarchus' original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book ''The Sand Reckoner'' (''Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli'') describes a work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model.
Copernicus studied medicine probably under the direction of leading Padua professors—Bartolomeo da Montagnana, Girolamo Fracastoro, Gabriele Zerbi, Alessandro Benedetti—and read medical treatises that he acquired at this time, by Valescus de Taranta, Jan Mesue, Hugo Senensis, Jan Ketham, Arnold de Villa Nova, and Michele Savonarola, which would form the embryo of his later medical library.
The name first appeared as a place name in Silesia in the 13th century, where it was spelled variously in Latin documents.
The corrections consisted largely of removing or altering wording that the spoke of heliocentrism as a fact, rather than a hypothesis.
The ''Commentariolus'' would appear complete in print for the first time only in 1878.
Like the Silesian village that inspired it, Copernicus's surname has been spelled variously.
Watzenrode was then able to form close relations with three successive Polish monarchs: John I Albert, Alexander Jagiellon, and Sigismund I the Old.
On the title page of ''De revolutionibus'', Rheticus published the name as (in the genitive, or possessive, case) "''Nicolai Copernici''".
Nicolaus' mother, Barbara Watzenrode, was the daughter of a wealthy Toruń patrician and city councillor, Lucas Watzenrode the Elder (deceased 1462), and Katarzyna (widow of Jan Peckau), mentioned in other sources as ''Katarzyna Rüdiger gente Modlibóg'' (deceased 1476).
Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory.
The DNA from the bones found in the grave matched hair samples taken from a book owned by Copernicus which was kept at the library of the University of Uppsala in Sweden.
Copernicus had used mathematics and astronomy to postulate about physics and cosmology, rather than beginning with the accepted principles of physics and cosmology to determine things about astronomy and mathematics.
Watzenrode's itinerary suggests that in spring 1509 Copernicus may have attended the Kraków sejm.
Elsewhere Protestants were the first to react to news of Copernicus's theory.
Aryabhata (476–550), in his magnum opus Aryabhatiya (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun.
It was probably the Padua years that saw the beginning of his Hellenistic interests.
As a result, Watzenrode quarreled with the king until Casimir IV's death three years later.
The vast majority of Copernicus's surviving works are in Latin, which in his lifetime was the language of academia in Europe.
Tolosani declared that he had written against Copernicus "for the purpose of preserving the truth to the common advantage of the Holy Church."
He explained that astronomers may find different causes for observed motions, and choose whatever is easier to grasp.
As long as a hypothesis allows reliable computation, it does not have to match what a philosopher might seek as the truth.
Tolosani invoked this view in his final critique of Copernicus, saying that his biggest error was that he had started with "inferior" fields of science to make pronouncements about "superior" fields.
In 1514 he purchased the northwestern tower within the walls of the Frombork stronghold.
Legend has it that he was presented with the final printed pages of his ''Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' on the very day that he died, allowing him to take farewell of his life's work.
Galileo himself was of the opinion that the essay played an important role in the rejection of the theory by church authorities, writing in a later letter to Ingoli that he was concerned that people thought the theory was rejected because Ingoli was right.
In 1517 he derived a quantity theory of money –&nbsp;a key concept in economics&nbsp;– and in 1519 he formulated a version of what later became known as Gresham's law.
According to Anthony Lauterbach, while eating with Martin Luther the topic of Copernicus arose during dinner on 4 June 1539 (in the same year as professor George Joachim Rheticus of the local University had been granted leave to visit him).
Following the death of Prince-Bishop of Warmia Mauritius Ferber (1 July 1537), Copernicus participated in the election of his successor, Johannes Dantiscus (20 September 1537).
Copernicus "was rather indifferent about orthography".
# General vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his idea of the World
His administrative and economic dutes did not distract Copernicus, in 1512–15, from intensive observational activity.
They maintain that neither the eighth sphere nor the sun moves, whereas they attribute motion to the other celestial spheres, and also place the earth among the heavenly bodies.
It was not until "after Isaac Newton formulated the universal law of gravitation and the laws of mechanics in his 1687 ''Principia'', which unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, was the heliocentric view generally accepted."
In 1526 he wrote a study on the value of money, ''Monetae cudendae ratio''.
In 1542 Rheticus published a treatise on trigonometry by Copernicus (later included in the second book of ''De revolutionibus'').
He would maintain both these residences to the end of his life, despite the devastation of the chapter's buildings by a raid against Frauenburg carried out by the Teutonic Order in January 1520, during which Copernicus's astronomical instruments were probably destroyed.
Qutb al-Din Shirazi (born 1236) also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism, but rejected it.41 Ibn al-Shatir (born 1304) developed a geocentric system that employed mathematical techniques, such as the Tusi couple and Urdi lemma, that were almost identical to those Nicolaus Copernicus later employed in his heliocentric system, implying that its mathematical model was influenced by the Maragha school.
Those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 ''Index''.
For unclear reasons—probably due to opposition from part of the chapter, who appealed to Rome—Copernicus's installation was delayed, inclining Watzenrode to send both his nephews to study canon law in Italy, seemingly with a view to furthering their ecclesiastic careers and thereby also strengthening his own influence in the Warmia chapter.
Gąssowski said he was "almost 100 percent sure it is Copernicus".
Without taking a degree, probably in the fall of 1495, Copernicus left Kraków for the court of his uncle Watzenrode, who in 1489 had been elevated to Prince-Bishop of Warmia and soon (before November 1495) sought to place his nephew in the Warmia canonry vacated by 26 August 1495 death of its previous tenant, Jan Czanow.
Latin was also the official language of the Roman Catholic Church and of Poland's royal court, and thus all of Copernicus's correspondence with the Church and with Polish leaders was in Latin.
The corrections were made based largely on work by Ingoli.
It was only on 20 October 1497 that Copernicus, by proxy, formally succeeded to the Warmia canonry which had been granted to him two years earlier.
Copernicus's father married Barbara Watzenrode, the astronomer's mother, between 1461 and 1464.
Toruń, situated on the Vistula River, was at that time embroiled in the Thirteen Years' War, in which the Kingdom of Poland and the Prussian Confederation, an alliance of Prussian cities, gentry and clergy, fought the Teutonic Order over control of the region.
Upon his father's death, young Nicolaus' maternal uncle, Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447–1512), took the boy under his wing and saw to his education and career.
In the difficult, politically complex situation of Warmia, threatened externally by the Teutonic Order's aggressions (attacks by Teutonic bands; the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519–21; Albert's plans to annex Warmia), internally subject to strong separatist pressures (the selection of the prince-bishops of Warmia; currency reform), he, together with part of the chapter, represented a program of strict cooperation with the Polish Crown and demonstrated in all his public activities (the defense of his country against the Order's plans of conquest; proposals to unify its monetary system with the Polish Crown's; support for Poland's interests in the Warmia dominion's ecclesiastic administration) that he was consciously a citizen of the Polish-Lithuanian Republic.
The father's family can be traced to a village in Silesia near Nysa (Neiße).
This is what ''that fellow'' does who wishes to turn the whole of astronomy upside down.
The German philosophy professor Martin Carrier mentions this as a reason to consider Copernicus's native language to have been German.
Polish astronomer Konrad Rudnicki calls the discussion a "fierce scholarly quarrel in ... times of nationalism" and describes Copernicus as an inhabitant of a German-speaking territory that belonged to Poland, himself being of mixed Polish-German extraction.
He held that Copernicus had come up with his idea and then sought phenomena that would support it, rather than observing phenomena and deducing from them the idea of what caused them.
Copernicus spent the jubilee year 1500 in Rome, where he arrived with his brother Andrew that spring, doubtless to perform an apprenticeship at the Papal Curia.
These included arguments about the effect of a moving earth on the trajectory of projectiles, and about parallax and Brahe's argument that the Copernican theory required that stars be absurdly large.
In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Teutonic Order formally relinquished all claims to its western province, which as Royal Prussia remained a region of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland until the First (1772) and Second (1793) Partitions of Poland.
The first of the great successors was Tycho Brahe (though he did not think the earth orbited the sun), followed by Johannes Kepler, who had worked as Tycho's assistant in Prague.
Though "it is not certain, it is probable that he Ingoli was commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy", (after the Congregation of the Index's decree against Copernicanism on 5 March 1616, Ingoli was officially appointed its consultant).
Forensic expert Capt.
Additionally, according to Davies, "there is ample evidence that he knew the Polish language".
There also seems to be evidence that it was during his Padua stay that the idea finally crystallized, of basing a new system of the world on the movement of the Earth.
The tombstone bears a representation of Copernicus's model of the solar system—a golden sun encircled by six of the planets.
Philipp Melanchthon, a close theological ally of Martin Luther, had arranged for Rheticus to visit several astronomers and study with them.
Copernicus was developing new ideas inspired by reading the "Epitome of the Almagest" (''Epitome in Almagestum Ptolemei'') by George von Peuerbach and Johannes Regiomontanus (Venice, 1496).
Copernicus was one of four candidates for the post, written in at the initiative of Tiedemann Giese; but his candidacy was actually ''pro forma'', since Dantiscus had earlier been named coadjutor bishop to Ferber.
After on 28 July receiving from the chapter a two-year extension of leave in order to study medicine (since "he may in future be a useful medical advisor to our Reverend Superior Bishop Lucas Watzenrode and the gentlemen of the chapter"), in late summer or in the fall he returned again to Italy, probably accompanied by his brother Andrew and by Canon B. Sculteti.
It was argued that mathematical numbers were a mere product of the intellect without any physical reality, and as such could not provide physical causes in the investigation of nature.
The prevailing theory in Europe during Copernicus's lifetime was the one that Ptolemy published in his ''Almagest'' circa 150 CE; the Earth was the stationary center of the universe.
In the winter semester of 1491–92 Copernicus, as "Nicolaus Nicolai de Thuronia", matriculated together with his brother Andrew at the University of Kraków (now Jagiellonian University).
Nicolaus Copernicus was born and raised in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and polyglot region under rule by the Kingdom of Poland.
It was only in early June 1512 that the chapter gave Copernicus an "external curia"—a house outside the defensive walls of the cathedral mount.
Copernicus the humanist sought confirmation for his growing doubts through close reading of Greek and Latin authors (Pythagoras, Aristarchos of Samos, Cleomedes, Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Philolaus, Heraclides, Ecphantos, Plato), gathering, especially while at Padua, fragmentary historic information about ancient astronomical, cosmological and calendar systems.
Nevertheless, in 1551, eight years after Copernicus's death, astronomer Erasmus Reinhold published, under the sponsorship of Copernicus's former military adversary, the Protestant Duke Albert, the ''Prussian Tables'', a set of astronomical tables based on Copernicus's work.
# Mainly theoretical, presents the principles of spherical astronomy and a list of stars (as a basis for the arguments developed in the subsequent books)
Poet Czesław Miłosz describes the debate as an "absurd" projection of a modern understanding of nationality onto Renaissance people, who identified with their home territories rather than with a nation.
Thus Copernicus seemed to be undermining the whole system of the philosophy of science at the time.
The first notable to move against Copernicanism was the Magister of the Holy Palace (i.e., the Catholic Church's chief censor), Dominican Bartolomeo Spina, who "expressed a desire to stamp out the Copernican doctrine".
Copernicus went willingly; he had met von Kunheim during negotiations over reform of the coinage.
In the spring of 1541, Duke Albert summoned Copernicus to Königsberg to attend the Duke's counselor, George von Kunheim, who had fallen seriously ill, and for whom the Prussian doctors seemed unable to do anything.
On 1 November 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg, Archbishop of Capua, wrote to Copernicus from Rome:
The ''Commentariolus'', which Copernicus consciously saw as merely a first sketch for his planned book, was not intended for printed distribution.
Copernicus was reportedly buried in Frombork Cathedral, where archaeologists for over two centuries searched in vain for his remains.
Historian Michael Burleigh describes the nationality debate as a "totally insignificant battle" between German and Polish scholars during the interwar period.
It is unclear whether he was ever ordained a priest.
His family stood against the Teutonic Order and actively supported the city of Toruń during the  Thirteen Years' War.
His brother Andreas (Andrew) became an Augustinian canon at Frombork (Frauenburg).
The father of Nicolaus Copernicus lent money to King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland to finance the war against the Teutonic Knights, but the inhabitants of Royal Prussia also resisted the Polish crown's efforts for greater control over the region.
The Catholic encyclopedia proposes that his ordination was probable, as he was one of four candidates for the episcopal seat of Ermland, a position which required ordination.
Georg Joachim Rheticus could have been Copernicus's successor, but did not rise to the occasion.
In the play, Copernicus was caricatured as a haughty, cold, aloof man who dabbled in astrology, considered himself inspired by God, and was rumored to have written a large work that was moldering in a chest.
# Exposition of the motions in latitude of the non-terrestrial planets
Copernicus never married or had children.
About 1532 Copernicus had basically completed his work on the manuscript of ''Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium''; but despite urging by his closest friends, he resisted openly publishing his views, not wishing—as he confessed—to risk the scorn "to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses."
Some astronomical hypotheses at the time (such as epicycles and eccentrics) were seen as mere mathematical devices to adjust calculations of where the heavenly bodies would appear, rather than an explanation of the cause of those motions.
In his official capacity, he took part in nearly all his uncle's political, ecclesiastic and administrative-economic duties.
It was a succinct theoretical description of the world's heliocentric mechanism, without mathematical apparatus, and differed in some important details of geometric construction from ''De revolutionibus''; but it was already based on the same assumptions regarding Earth's triple motions.
He dismissed arguments that they should be taken metaphorically, saying "Replies which assert that Scripture speaks according to our mode of understanding are not satisfactory: both because in explaining the Sacred Writings the rule is always to preserve the literal sense, when it is possible, as it is in this case; and also because all the Church Fathers unanimously take this passage to mean that the sun which was truly moving stopped at Joshua's request.
These remarks were made four years before the publication of ''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'' and a year before Rheticus' ''Narratio Prima''.
# Mainly dedicated to the apparent motions of the Sun and to related phenomena
Ingoli wrote a January 1616 essay to Galileo presenting more than twenty arguments against the Copernican theory.
Here, too, however, he continued his astronomical work begun at Bologna, observing, for example, a lunar eclipse on the night of 5–6 November 1500.
Lucas and Katherine had three children: Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447–1512), who would become Bishop of Warmia and Copernicus's patron; Barbara, the astronomer's mother (deceased after 1495); and Christina (deceased before 1502), who in 1459 married the Toruń merchant and mayor, Tiedeman von Allen.
An interpretation which is contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers is condemned by the Council of Trent, Session IV, in the decree on the edition and use of the Sacred Books.
# Exposition of the motions in longitude of the non-terrestrial planets
It has been much debated why it was not until six decades after the publication of ''De revolutionibus'' that the Catholic Church took any official action against it, even the efforts of Tolosani going unheeded.
Watzenrode maintained contacts with leading intellectual figures in Poland and was a friend of the influential Italian-born humanist and Kraków courtier, Filippo Buonaccorsi.
He also, in 1517, set down a quantity theory of money, a principal concept in economics to the present day.
While Rheticus initially supervised the printing, he had to leave Nuremberg before it was completed, and he handed over the task of supervising the rest of the printing to a Lutheran theologian, Andreas Osiander.
Copernicus for years advised the Royal Prussian sejmik on monetary reform, particularly in the 1520s when that was a major question in regional Prussian politics.
Miłosz and Davies both write that Copernicus had a German-language cultural background, while his working language was Latin in accord with the usage of the time.
At Kraków Copernicus began collecting a large library on astronomy; it would later be carried off as war booty by the Swedes during the Deluge in the 1650s and is now at the Uppsala University Library.
He also spoke Polish, Greek and Italian.
First, Copernicus had assumed the motion of the Earth but offered no physical theory whereby one would deduce this motion.
Toward the close of 1542, Copernicus was seized with apoplexy and paralysis, and he died at age 70 on 24 May 1543.
The Modlibógs were a prominent Polish family who had been well known in Poland's history since 1271.
To this, by a document dated 10 January 1503 at Padua, he would add a sinecure at the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross in Wrocław, Silesia, Bohemia.
From this situation, there could easily arise disagreements between Catholic expositors of holy scripture and those who might wish to adhere obstinately to this false opinion."
It contained seven basic assumptions (detailed below).
As at Bologna, Copernicus did not limit himself to his official studies.
Copernicus was his uncle's secretary and physician from 1503 to 1510 (or perhaps till his uncle's death on 29 March 1512) and resided in the Bishop's castle at Lidzbark (Heilsberg), where he began work on his heliocentric theory.
The earth has, then, more than one motion.
Copernicus's Kraków studies gave him a thorough grounding in the mathematical-astronomical knowledge taught at the university (arithmetic, geometry, geometric optics, cosmography, theoretical and computational astronomy), a good knowledge of the philosophical and natural-science writings of Aristotle (''De coelo'', ''Metaphysics''), stimulated his interest in learning, and made him conversant with humanistic culture.
Copernicus's four years at Kraków played an important role in the development of his critical faculties and initiated his analysis of the logical contradictions in the two most popular systems of astronomy—Aristotle's theory of homocentric spheres, and Ptolemy's mechanism of eccentrics and epicycles—the surmounting and discarding of which constituted the first step toward the creation of Copernicus's own doctrine of the structure of the universe.
Annales Clarissimae Nacionis Germanorum'', of the ''Natio Germanica Bononiae'', as ''Dominus Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn – IX grosseti''.
Copernicus was the child of German-speaking parents and grew up with German as his mother tongue.
No doubt it was soon after (at latest, in fall 1503) that he left Italy for good to return to Warmia.
At the Maragha observatory, Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī (died 1277), in his ''Hikmat al-'Ain'', wrote an argument for a heliocentric model, but later abandoned the model.
...his arguments have no force and can very easily be taken apart.
The Pope was so pleased that he gave Widmanstetter a valuable gift.
Second, Tolosani charged that Copernicus's thought process was backwards.
''De revolutionibus'' itself was divided into six parts, called "books":
At Bologna, in 1496, he registered in the ''Matricula Nobilissimi Germanorum Collegii, resp.
He died about 1483.
He must do something of his own.
Tolosani wrote that Copernicus "is expert indeed in the sciences of mathematics and astronomy, but he is very deficient in the sciences of physics and logic.
He was a friend and key advisor to each ruler, and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between Warmia and Poland proper.
It was probably on the latter occasion, in Kraków, that Copernicus submitted for printing at Jan Haller's press his translation, from Greek to Latin, of a collection, by the 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, of 85 brief poems called Epistles, or letters, supposed to have passed between various characters in a Greek story.
The physical and mathematical arguments were of uneven quality, but many of them came directly from the writings of Tycho Brahe, and Ingoli repeatedly cited Brahe, the leading astronomer of the era.
Tycho Brahe's system ("that the earth is stationary, the sun revolves about the earth, and the other planets revolve about the sun") also directly competed with Copernicus's.
When he later studied in Italy, Copernicus joined the "German Nation", the student organization for German speakers at the University of Bologna.
Copernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, a region that had been a part of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466.
By then Copernicus's work was nearing its definitive form, and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over Europe.
Davies concludes: "Taking everything into consideration, there is good reason to regard him both as a German and as a Pole: and yet, in the sense that modern nationalists understand it, he was neither."
# Description of the Moon and its orbital motions
The results of his observations of Mars and Saturn in this period, and especially a series of four observations of the Sun made in 1515, led to discovery of the variability of Earth's eccentricity and of the movement of the solar apogee in relation to the fixed stars, which in 1515–19 prompted his first revisions of certain assumptions of his system.
In Roman Catholic circles, German Jesuit Nicolaus Serarius was one of the first to write against Copernicus's theory as heretical, citing the Joshua passage, in a work published in 1609–1610, and again in a book in 1612.
He also represented the Polish side in the ensuing peace negotiations.
In about a month the patient recovered, and Copernicus returned to Frombork.
What appear to us as motions of the sun arise not from its motion but from the motion of the earth and our sphere, with which we revolve about the sun like any other planet.
Moreover, it appears that he is unskilled with regard to the interpretation of holy scripture, since he contradicts several of its principles, not without danger of infidelity to himself and the readers of his book.
This time he studied at the University of Padua, famous as a seat of medical learning, and—except for a brief visit to Ferrara in May–June 1503 to pass examinations for, and receive, his doctorate in canon law—he remained at Padua from fall 1501 to summer 1503.
Even in these things that are thrown into disorder I believe the Holy Scriptures, for Joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth."
Another Protestant theologian who took issue with Copernicus was John Owen who declared that "the late hypothesis, fixing the sun as in the centre of the world' was 'built on fallible phenomena, and advanced by many arbitrary presumptions against evident testimonies of Scripture."
In later years he was called upon to attend the elderly bishops who in turn occupied the see of Warmia—Mauritius Ferber and Johannes Dantiscus – and, in 1539, his old friend Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Chełmno (Kulm).
There survive a few documents written by Copernicus in German.
And Copernicus had come to feel that Albert himself was not such a bad person; the two had many intellectual interests in common.
Efforts to locate the remains in 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 had come to nought.
Ingoli cited Robert Bellarmine in regards to both of these arguments, and may have been trying to convey to Galileo a sense of Bellarmine's opinion.
Ingoli presented five physical arguments against the theory, thirteen mathematical arguments (plus a separate discussion of the sizes of stars), and four theological arguments.
In his commentary on Psalms 93:1 he states that "The heavens revolve daily, and, immense as is their fabric and inconceivable the rapidity of their revolutions, we experience no concussion.... How could the earth hang suspended in the air were it not upheld by God's hand?
In Copernicus's time, people were often called after the places where they lived.
The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.
His sister Katharina married the businessman and Toruń city councilor Barthel Gertner and left five children, whom Copernicus looked after to the end of his life.
