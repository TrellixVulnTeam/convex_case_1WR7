However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now.
One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is Irvin D. Yalom.
To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is "there" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things.
(1968) (now republished as ''Blade Runner'') by Philip K. Dick, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' by Kurt Vonnegut, and ''Fight Club'' by Chuck Palahniuk all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes.

This way of living, Heidegger called "average everydayness".
Here it is also clear that since humans can choose to be either cruel or good, they are, in fact, neither of these things essentially.
However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.
The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism, which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.
Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions.
Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.
What is meant by authenticity is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as "one's acts" or as "one's genes" or any other essence requires.
Facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom.
The use of the word "nothing" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences.
''Introduction to the New Existentialism''), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience.
Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable.
We shall devote to them a future work."
Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school.

He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.
Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory".
By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to Christianity as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes.
Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as "the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism."
All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives.
The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of H.P.
A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body — e.g.
Two Russian thinkers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev, became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris.
More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity.
The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence.
However, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that  would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic.
For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is "man with man", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called "sphere of between" (''"das Zwischenmenschliche"'').
Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time.

Sartre reverses this statement.
Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered."
For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if she has nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for her identity.
Of course, as a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background for making the choice one made).
According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself.
Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke, T.S.
The film ''The Shawshank Redemption'', released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine, United States to explore several existentialist concepts.

If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds his being-thing compromised, he would normally be found in state of despair — a hopeless state.
'''Existentialism''' () is a term applied to the work of certain late-19th- and 20th-century European philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences, shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.
It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC.
Another Spanish thinker, Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: "''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''" ("I am myself and my circumstances").
As Sartre writes in his work ''Existentialism is a Humanism'': "... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards."
Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.
Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T.
Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there).
Many critics argue Sartre's philosophy is contradictory.
Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively.
Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing them upon him, but as though they are inside him and guiding him from inside.

It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with "a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential".
Louis-Ferdinand Céline's ''Journey to the End of the Night'' (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel.
Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling.

The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell.
It is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide" in his ''The Myth of Sisyphus''.
Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons).
Like Pascal, they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom.
Existentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose positivism and rationalism.
For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person.
The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does.
Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything.

This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity.
Charlie Kaufman's ''Synecdoche, New York'' focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning.
In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem.
Of course, the more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.
This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, to a sort of "mimicry" where one acts as "one should."
Colin Wilson has stated in his book ''The Angry Years'' that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: "we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom, we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole".
Existentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd, notably in Samuel Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'', in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives.
The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his 1913 book ''The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations'', emphasized the life of "flesh and bone" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism.
Sartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that ''existence precedes essence'', which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible, conscious beings ("existence")—rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit ("essence").
The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, André Breton, and Jacques Lacan.
As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything.
She finds herself unable to be what defined her being.
Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd.
This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze).
Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel ''Nausea'' and the short stories in his 1939 collection ''The Wall'', and had published his treatise on existentialism, ''Being and Nothingness'', in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates — Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others — became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.
The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding.
The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's ''Hamlet''.
Although "prescriptions" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious "stage" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers.
In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially).
Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms ''All Things Are Possible''.
He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that "Hegelians do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy".
The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court-martialed by a "kangaroo court", and executed by firing squad.

They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of National Socialism.
In ''Letter on Humanism'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:
Existentialism became popular in the years following World War II, and strongly influenced many disciplines besides philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.
Despair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope.
Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: "Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think.
one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound —identity, values, etc.
After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked.
''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' is a Japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno.
This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or "unfairness" of the world.
His seminal work ''The Courage to Be'' follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity.
The notion of the Absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history.
Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled "Absurdist" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with 'Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.
For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted "extravagant" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.
This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life-or the learner who should put it to use?"
Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film ''Paths of Glory'' "illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism" by examining the "necessary absurdity of the human condition" and the "horror of war".
Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it.
Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.
It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work ''Humanism and Terror'' greatly influenced Sartre.
Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard:
Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.
The Other (when written with a capital "O") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity.
Although Jean-Paul Sartre adopted the term "existentialism" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as "almost diametrically opposed" to that of Sartre.
In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately "Ante-GŌN."
Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality.
While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom.
The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist micro-sociology, symbolic interactionism, and post-structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Michel Foucault.
Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret, Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his ''Letter on Humanism''.
What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when he isn't overtly in despair.
The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France.
So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, he is in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition.
Some scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus.
Orson Welles' 1962 film '' The Trial'', based upon Franz Kafka's book of the same name (Der Process), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader.

How "one should" act is often determined by an image one has of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.)
His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy.
However, even though one's facticity is "set in stone" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person.
Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets.
Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including ''The Rebel'', ''Summer in Algiers'', ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', and ''The Stranger'', the latter being "considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel."
An existentialist reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that he is an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events.
Specifically, they argue that the verb is transitive and pre-fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple ''is red'') (without a predicate, the word is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner.
The notion of the Absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it.
She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.
Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith.
In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''.
Dostoyevsky's ''Notes from Underground'' portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself.
Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel ''Nausea'' was "steeped in Existential ideas", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance.
To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom.
Paul Tillich, an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology, and helped introduce existential theology to the general public.
), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it.
Many of the literary works of Søren Kierkegaard, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Eugène Ionesco, Miguel de Unamuno, Luigi Pirandello, Jean-Paul Sartre, Joseph Heller and Albert Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.
For Jaspers, "''Existenz''-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker."
Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through "secondary reflection", a "dialogical" rather than "dialectical" approach to the world, characterized by "wonder and astonishment" and open to the "presence" of other people and of God rather than merely to "information" about them.
The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian Rune Slagstad, who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term "existential" was borrowed from the poet.
However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence.
The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical freedom and our awareness of death.
It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.
The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern.
Facticity is a concept defined by Sartre in ''Being and Nothingness'' as the ''in-itself'', which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being.
Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics.
Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay "On The Concept of Irony".
The play "exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos."
However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, who sided with Sartre.
The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions.
This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself.
Eventually he is joined by two women.
Marcel contrasted ''secondary reflection'' with abstract, scientific-technical ''primary reflection'', which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego.
An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was Rollo May, who was strongly influenced by Kierkegaard and Otto Rank.
