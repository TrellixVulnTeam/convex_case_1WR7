The speaker must have prior world knowledge and an understanding of the grammatical rules that their language enforces.
These movements can occur singularly, in sequence, or simultaneously.
The subject-auxiliary inversion and do-support has applied to an idiomatic expression causing the insertion of "do" when it should not be applied in the ungrammatical utterance.
The table below shows that production of long to short phrases is preferred and that this preference increases as the size of the differential between the two phrases increases.
In contrast, in (1b) the VP is still composed of three ICs but there are now six words that are required to determine the constituent structure of the VP (''went, in, the, late, afternoon, to'').
"this is the boy that cuts the tomato and this is the boy that the bread"
''Pat VPwrote PPon the blackboard NP something about Chris. ''
In contrast, in 4b.,where heavy-NP shift has shifted the NP to the right, as soon as "to" is uttered the listener knows that the VP must contain the NP and a PP.
The listener may also be the speaker.

This causes "do-support" to occur and the verb to lack tense causing the syntactic error.

*Structural analysis

Old Lady, what will you do now?
He introduces the concepts of early versus late commitment, where commitment is the point in the utterance where it becomes possible to predict subsequent structure.
In this indice, each consecutive utterance, or sentence, elicited from a child is scored.
Both the T-units and C-units count each clause as a new unit, hence a lower number of units.

To test his predictions Wasow analyzed performance data (from corpora data) for the rates of occurrence of HNPS for Vt and Vp and found HNPS occurred twice as frequently in Vp than in Vt, therefore supporting the predictions made from the speaker's perspective.
Performance preference is related to structure complexity and processing, or comprehension, efficiency.
Comparatively, late commitment will favour the speaker by postponing decision making, giving the speaker more time to plan the utterance.

For example, 60% of the sentences are ordered short (PP1) to long (PP2) when PP2 was longer than PP1 by 1 word.
The main advantage of development sentence scoring is that the final score represents the individual's general syntactic development and allows for easier tracking of changes in language development, making this tool effective for longitudinal studies.
Emphasizes revealing the structure of Langue through the study of Parole.
Performance requires extra-linguistic knowledge such as an awareness of the speaker, audience and the context, which crucially determines how speech is constructed and analyzed.
Similar to the performance/competence distinction, I-Language is the internalized innate knowledge of language; E-Language is the externalized observable output.

Thus, the ratio for (1b) is 3/6 = 50%.
Literal paraphasia causes disorganization of linguistic properties, resulting in errors of word order of phonemes.
After this, occurrences of a sub-scale are not scored.
This example from Fromkin (1980) demonstrates a rule misanalyzing the tense marker and for subject-auxiliary inversion to be incorrectly applied.
"Which book" do you want?)
Proposed in the 1950s by Noam Chomsky, generative grammar is an analysis approach to language as a structural framework of the human mind.
Levelt (1993) states that we as speakers are unaware of most of these levels of performance such as '''articulation''', which includes the movement and placement of the articulators, the '''formulation''' of the utterance which includes the words selected and their pronunciation and the rules which must be followed for the utterance to be grammatical.
'''Child productions''' when they are acquiring language are full of errors of linguistic performance.

'''Interrogative reversals'''
Errors of linguistic performance are perceived by both the speaker and the listener and can therefore have many interpretations depending on the persons judgement and the context in which the sentence was spoken.
In each of the four sub-scales previously mentioned, the first two unique occurrences of a form are scored.
"He bit, the fish did."
Errors in linguistic performance not only occur in children newly acquiring their native language, second language learners, those with a disability or an acquired brain injury but among competent speakers as well.
Here's an example of how to calculate MLU:
Lise Menn proposes that there are five levels of processing in speech production, each with its own possible error that could occur.
Speakers make an automatic calculation of the Immediate Constituent(IC)-to-word order ratio and produce the structure with the highest ratio.
Noam Chomsky (1986)
The subject-auxiliary inversion is misanalyzed as to which structure it applies, applying without the verb ''be'' in the tense as it moves to the C position.
71 sequences had PPs of equal length (total n=394)
errors can occur due to the application of (a) the rule misanalyzing the tense marker causing the rule to apply incorrectly, (b) the rule not being applied when it should or (c) a rule being applied when it should not.

Phonological and semantic errors can be due to the repetition of words, mispronunciations, limitations in verbal working memory, and length of the utterance.

#Phonological Encoding
This model seeks to explain word order across languages based on avoidance of unnecessary complexity in favour of increased processing efficiency.
As well the context in which an utterance is used can determine if the error would be considered or not.
''Tanaka NOM  Hanako from that book ACC bought''
''Langue ''describes the mental knowledge of how to systematically apply signs.
The following example from Fromkin (1980) shows the relative clause rule copies the determiner phrase "a boy" within the clause and this causes front attaching to the Wh-marker.

The term '''linguistic performance''' was used by Noam Chomsky in 1960 to describe "the actual use of language in concrete situations".
However, if a child has mastered a complex syntax structure earlier than expected, they will receive extra points.
Transformations in Error
Noam Chomsky (1965)
This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences.
These processes can be anticipation, preservation, or metathesis.
It allows the signer to articulate what they are wanting to communicate by extending, flexing, bending or spreading the digits; the position of the thumb to the fingers; or the curvature of the hand.
For example, ordering of the longer 2ICm (where ICm is either a direct object NP with an accusative case particle or a PP constructed from the right periphery) before the shorter 1ICm is more frequent, and the frequency increases to 91% if the 2ICm is longer than the 1ICm by 9+ words.
"What" do you mean?
Transformational errors are a mental operation proposed by Chomsky in his Transformational Hypothesis and it has three parts which errors in performance can occur.
'''Score of 6:''' both, many, several, most, least
This is because at around age 3, MLU does not distinguish between children of similar language competency as well as Index of Productive Syntax does.
This density is calculated as a ratio of the total number of clauses across sentences, divide by the number of sentences in a discourse sample.
SVO word order can be exemplified with English; consider the example sentences in (1).
The performance preference for long to short phrase ordering in SVO languages is supported by performance data.
The scores of all the utterances are totalled in the end of the analysis and then averaged to get a final score.
'''Movement''' is the most complex as it can be difficult to analyze.
A boy who I know a boy has hair down to here
Structures with a high IC-to-word order are structures that contain the fewest number of words required for the listener to parse the structure into constituents which results in more efficient processing.
When comparing "Who must telephone her?"
Speakers and listeners can be aided in the performance and processing of these sentences by eliminating time and memory constraints, increasing motivation to process these utterances and using pen and paper.

Between I-Language and competence, I-Language refers to our intrinsic faculty for language, competence is used by Chomsky as an informal, general term, or as term with reference to a specific competency such as "grammatical competence" or "pragmatic competence".
"Which" do you want?
It is also governed by principles of cognitive structures not considered aspects of language, such as memory, distractions, attention, and speech errors.

This includes languages with VSO word order such as from Hungarian.
It is this structural complexity that results in decreased processing efficiency since more structure requires additional processing.

emerges as having a higher ratio than 2b.
While the dominant views of grammar are largely oriented towards competence, many, including Chomsky himself, have argued that a complete model of grammar should be able to account for performance data.
Another proposal for the levels of speech processing is made by Willem J. M. Levelt to be structured as so:
go (=1) home (=1) now (=1)
mNP2 > mNP1 by 1 word
Errors can occur in the carrying out of rules, even though the analysis of the phrase marker is done correctly.
This is a commonly applied measurement of syntax for first and second language learners, with samples gathered from both elicited and spontaneous oral discourse.

Errors in performance can occur at any level of these psychological processes.

For example, if the clause density is 2.0, the ratio would indicate that the sentence being analyzed has 2 clauses on average: one main clause and one subordinate clause.
The idea is to examine the patterns of HNPS to determine if the performance data show sentences that are structured to favour the speaker or the listener.

Syntactic categories measured by developmental sentence scoring with examples:
Specifically, a complex structure refers to a structure containing more linguistic elements or words at the end of the structure than at the beginning.
This last example from Fromkin (1980) shows that a rule was applied under a certain condition in which it is restricted.
However, when comparing it to "Who want telephone her?"
This study looked at the ordering of two successive noun phrases (NPs) and found that the shorter NP followed by the longer NP is preferred in performance, and that this preference increases as the size differential between NP1 and NP2 increases.
Hawkins argues that the preference for short followed by long phrases applies to all languages that have head-initial structuring.
This can occur when the analysis requires multiple rules to occur.
The Hungarian performance data (below) show the same preference pattern as the English data.
