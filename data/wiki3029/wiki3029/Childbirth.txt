The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pains that last around half a minute and occur every ten to thirty minutes.
In the developed world most deliveries occur in hospital, while in the developing world most births take place at home with the support of a traditional birth attendant.
Jurisdictions where midwifery is a regulated profession will typically have a registering and disciplinary body for quality control, such as the American Midwifery Certification Board in the United States, the College of Midwives of British Columbia (CMBC) in Canada or the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in the United Kingdom.
Using animal studies that have shown that  the intimate contact inherent  in skin-to-skin contact promotes neurobehaviors that result in the fulfillment of basic biological needs as a model, recent studies have been done to assess what, if any, advantages may be associated with early skin-to-skin contact for human mothers and their babies.
Health conditions that may warrant induced labour or cesarean delivery include gestational or chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, diabetes, premature rupture of membranes, severe fetal growth restriction, and post-term pregnancy.
In the United States and elsewhere, classes for training as a childbirth educator can be found in hospital settings or through many independent certifying organizations such as Birthing From Within, BirthWorks, The Bradley Method, Birth Arts International, CAPPA, HypBirth, HypnoBabies, HypnoBirthing, ICTC, ICEA, Lamaze, etc.
A number of methods can help with pain such as relaxation techniques, opioids, and spinal blocks.
Vaginal discharge, termed "lochia", can be expected to continue for several weeks; initially bright red, it gradually becomes  pink, changing to brown, and finally to yellow or white.
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most deaths occur during the postnatal period.
This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.
Vaginal birth injury is a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of all non hysterectomy related prolapse in later life.
The work of Ignaz Semmelweis was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of puerperal fever and saved many lives.
*three to four contractions every ten minutes
The duration of labour varies widely, but the active phase averages some 8 hours for women giving birth to their first child ("primiparae") and shorter for women who have already given birth ("multiparae").
More invasive monitoring can involve a fetal scalp electrode to give an additional measure of fetal heart activity, and/or intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC).
Oxytocin is further released during labour when the fetus stimulates the cervix and vagina, and it is believed that it plays a major role in the bonding of a mother to her infant and in the establishment of maternal behavior.
True intrapartum asphyxia is not as common as previously believed, and is usually accompanied by multiple other symptoms during the immediate period after delivery.
Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006, and comprise nearly 32% of births in the U.S. and Canada.
A mother's water has to break before internal (invasive) monitoring can be used.
During stays with ICU services, approximately 20% of costs were attributable to the ICU.
About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12% were born after 42 weeks.
This may be a result of a synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.
The fetal head rotates 90 degrees to the occipito-anterior position so that the baby's face is towards the mother's rectum.
Each organization teaches its own curriculum and each emphasizes different techniques.
The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis.
"Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex."
Active management is described as the administration of a uterotonic drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and fundal massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours.
A large review of methods of induction was published in 2011.
Some practitioners may diagnose "Failure to Progress", and consequently, propose interventions to optimize chances for healthy outcome.
Mothers were told that their newborn would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mother more time to rest.
The first stage typically lasts twelve to nineteen hours, the second stage twenty minutes to two hours, and the third stage five to thirty minutes.
As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a "rooming in" option wherein after a period of routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother's room.
Afterpains (pains similar to menstrual cramps), contractions of the uterus to prevent excessive blood flow, continue for several days.
Medical researchers find that neonates born before 39 weeks experienced significantly more complications (2.5 times more in one study) compared with those delivered at 39 to 40 weeks.
Over longer distances, however, signaling may involve a mechanical mechanism.
Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days  with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth, however they found that women experienced more anterior perineal damage with restrictive episiotomy.
Obstructed labour, also known as dystocia, is when, even though the uterus is contracting normally, the baby does not exit the pelvis during childbirth due to being physically blocked.
During the second stage pushing with contractions may occur.
Specific complications include obstructed labour, postpartum bleeding, eclampsia, and postpartum infection.
Some families view the placenta as a special part of birth, since it has been the child's life support for so many months.
# '''Internal rotation'''.
During effacement, the cervix becomes incorporated into the lower segment of the uterus.
The "natural" maternal mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated at 1500 deaths per 100,000 births.
This is referred to as "delivery en caul".
Caesarean section is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.
Every year, more than half a million women die in pregnancy or childbirth.
# '''Descent and flexion''' of the fetal head.
Active management of labour consists of a number of care principles, including frequent assessment of cervical dilatation.
Per these guidelines, the following conditions may be an indication for induction, including:
Different measures for pain control have varying degrees of success and side effects to the woman and her baby.
In contrast, Braxton Hicks contractions, which are contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called "false labour", should be infrequent, irregular, and involve only mild cramping.
As pressure on the cervix increases, women may have the sensation of pelvic pressure and an urge to begin pushing.
Latent phase ends with the onset of active first stage, and this transition is defined retrospectively.
The ACOG also note that contraindications for induced labour are the same as for spontaneous vaginal delivery, including vasa previa, complete placenta praevia, umbilical cord prolapse or active genital herpes simplex infection.
Postpartum depression may develop in some women; about 10% of mothers in the United States are diagnosed with this condition.
*rupture of membranes
The median cost associated with home birth was estimated to be about $1,500 vs. about $2,500 in hospital.
* The need to repair large tears after delivery.
In Western countries, such as the United States and Sweden, the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.
Vaginal tears can occur during childbirth, most often at the vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, especially if the baby descends quickly.
Some organisms such as S. agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) or (GBS) are more prone to cause these occasionally fatal infections.
The injection of small amounts of sterile water into or just below the skin at several points on the back has been a method tried to reduce labour pain, but no good evidence shows that it actually helps.
In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section.
The review found that restrictive episiotomy policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine episiotomy.
It is currently possible to collect two types of stem cells during childbirth: amniotic stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells.
A recent Cochrane overview of systematic reviews on non-drug interventions found that relaxation techniques, immersion in water, massage, and acupuncture may provide pain relief.
Complete expulsion of the baby signals the successful completion of the second stage of labour.
At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the pelvic inlet.
'''Pelvic girdle pain'''.
They are being studied as possible treatments of a number of conditions.
* Premature rupture of membranes
* A baby weighing more than 9 pounds.
Monitoring with a cardiotocograph can either be intermittent or continuous.
# '''External rotation'''.
In the case of cesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labour at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labour cesarean at 38 weeks.
The second stage of birth will vary by factors including parity (the number of children a woman has had), fetal size, anesthesia, and the presence of infection.
The review did find side effects including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor.
In addition, women were less likely to use pain medications, were more likely to be satisfied, and had slightly shorter labours.
This definition is based on Friedman's Curve, which plots the typical rate of cervical dilation and fetal descent during active labour.
Women are often encouraged to refrain from screaming, but moaning and grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain.
The degree of cervical effacement may be felt during a vaginal examination.
The placenta may be eaten by the newborn's family, ceremonially or otherwise (for nutrition; the great majority of animals in fact do this naturally).
Obstetrical procedures include cesarean sections, episiotomies, and assisted delivery.
These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions.
Medicine administered via epidural can cross the placenta and enter the bloodstream of the fetus.
Full dilation is reached when the cervix has widened enough to allow passage of the baby's head, around 10&nbsp;cm dilation for a term baby.
Most babies are born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech.
Longer labours are associated with declining rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing rates of infection, perineal laceration, and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the need for intensive care of the neonate.
When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement).
It involves three stages of labour: the shortening and opening of the cervix, descent and birth of the baby, and the pushing out of the placenta.
'''Childbirth''', also known as '''labour and delivery''', is the ending of a pregnancy by one or more babies leaving a woman's uterus.
A 2009 Cochrane review found no evidence of any benefit with perineal shaving.
The mother should have  regular assessments for uterine contraction and fundal height, vaginal bleeding, heart rate and blood pressure, and temperature, for the first 24 hours after birth.
Humans are bipedal with an erect stance.
The active stage of labour (or "active phase of first stage" if the previous phase is termed "latent phase of first stage") has geographically differing definitions.
The signaling mechanisms responsible for uterine coordination are complex.
As of June 2011, about one third of American births have some complications, "many of which are directly related to the mother's health."
It is the time in which the mother's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, return to a non-pregnant state and the newborn adjusts to life outside the mother's body.
Some reports note that the onset of term labour more commonly takes place in the late night and early morning hours.
There is not enough evidence to make conclusions about unwanted effects in mothers or babies.
Popular medical pain control in hospitals include the regional anesthetics epidurals (EDA), and spinal anaesthesia.
Left untreated, severe complications include death of mother and/or baby, and genitovaginal fistula.
give birth with neither caesarean nor vacuum nor forceps.
Studies have found that continuous support during labor and delivery reduce the need for medication and a caesarean or operative vaginal delivery, and result in an improved Apgar score for the infant.
The most prominent sign of labour is strong repetitive uterine contractions.
* Postterm pregnancy
At one time shaving of the area around the vagina, was common practice due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an episiotomy (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries.
Ripening of the cervix can be accomplished with the placement of a Foley catheter or the use of synthetic prostaglandins such as misoprostol.
* prematurity (birth before 37 weeks gestation)
Evidence of benefit with chlorhexidine is lacking.
Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and shoulder dystocia.
childbirth is not finished until the baby has safely transferred from placental to mammary nutrition."
* The use of forceps or vacuum for delivery.
While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) in the event of an emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean.
The rate of labour induction in the United States is 22%, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2006.
Opioids such as fentanyl may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant.
In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled nitrous oxide gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as Entonox; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription.
Some women prefer to avoid analgesic medication during childbirth.
possible during the first days after delivery, especially if it was interrupted for some reason after the delivery.
A 1983–1989 study by the Texas Department of State Health Services highlighted the differences in neonatal mortality (NMR) between high risk and low risk pregnancies.

Other methods of inducing labour include stripping of the amniotic membrane, artificial rupturing of the amniotic sac (called amniotomy), or nipple stimulation.
In the third stage delayed clamping of the umbilical cord is generally recommended.
Blood transfusion may be life saving.
Like childbirth educators and other assistive personnel, certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator.
Acupuncture and relaxation were found to decrease the number of caesarean sections required.
This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of "bearing down" or pushing.
Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour.
These "early term" births were also associated with increased death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks ("full term").
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also advises  postponing procedures such as weighing, measuring, and bathing for at least 1 hour to insure an initial period of skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant.
Immersion in water has been found to relieve pain during the first stage of labor and to reduce the need for anesthesia and shorten the duration of labor, however the safety and efficacy of immersion during birth, water birth, has not been established or associated with maternal or fetal benefit.
The WHO suggests that any initial observations of the infant can be done while the infant remains close to the mother, saying that even a brief separation before the baby has had its first feed can disturb the bonding process.
* Gestational hypertension
For low risk pregnancies all three result in similar outcomes.
Pain in contractions has been described as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps.
In the United States, childbirth hospital stays have some of the lowest ICU utilizations.
While making a cut to the opening of the vagina, known as an episiotomy, is common it is generally not needed.
Personal expectations, the amount of support from caregivers, quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and involvement in decision-making are more important in women's overall satisfaction with the experience of childbirth than are other factors such as age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, preparation, physical environment, pain, immobility, or medical interventions.
Health care providers may assess a labouring mother's progress in labour by performing a cervical exam to evaluate the cervical dilation, effacement, and station.
Medical doctors who practice obstetrics include categorically specialized obstetricians, family practitioners and general practitioners whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, and in some contexts general surgeons.
The presenting fetal part then is permitted to descend.
Following the birth, if the mother had an  episiotomy or a tearing of the perineum, it is stitched.
The shoulders repeat the corkscrew movements of the head, which can be seen in the final movements of the fetal head.
Eating or drinking during labour is an area of ongoing debate.
Cesarean section too may be of benefit to both the mother and baby for certain indications including maternal HIV/AIDS, fetal abnormality, breech position, fetal distress, multiple gestations, and maternal medical conditions which would be worsened by labour or vaginal birth.
The first passing of urine should be documented within 6 hours.
The summed cost of prenatal care, childbirth, and newborn care came to $30,000 for a vaginal delivery and $50,000 for a caesarian section.
The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network.
The fetal head turns through 45 degrees to restore its normal relationship with the shoulders, which are still at an angle.
Researchers found benefits to going full term and "no adverse effects" in the health of the mothers or babies.
Until recently babies born in hospitals were removed from their mothers shortly after birth and brought to the mother only at feeding times.
*cervical dilation of 3 to 4&nbsp;cm
"Childbirth educators" are instructors who aim to educate pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care.
The distress levels reported by labouring women vary widely.
Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother.
When the amniotic sac has not ruptured during labour or pushing, the infant can be born with the membranes intact.
# '''Restitution'''.
Epidural analgesia has no statistically significant impact on the risk of caesarean section, and does not appear to have an immediate effect on neonatal status as determined by Apgar scores.
These factors form the Bishop score.
Risk factors for GBS infection include:
During a contraction, uterine muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the lower segment, in a gradual expulsive motion.
Midwives are autonomous practitioners who provide basic and emergency health care before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, generally to women with low-risk pregnancies.
Information about each can be obtained through their individual websites.
It is currently less common, though it is still a routine procedure in some countries.
This has been done in an effort to increase the rates of vaginal delivery.
Factors that may make a birth high risk include prematurity, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and a previous cesarean section.
Their babies were less likely to have low five-minute Apgar scores."
Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic chlorhexidine or providone-iodine solution in the vagina.
A 'long' cervix implies that effacement has not yet occurred.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and medical policy makers review research studies and find increased incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, Hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization > 4 – 5 days.
'''Station''' refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines.

The most common way of childbirth is a vaginal delivery.
The crampy pains become stronger and closer together over time.
Anaesthetists or anesthesiologists are medical doctors who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures.
Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position.
Risk factors for fetal birth injury include fetal macrosomia (big baby), maternal obesity, the need for instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant.
'''Vaginal birth injury''' with visible tears or episiotomies are common.
Health problems among babies delivered "pre-term" included respiratory distress, jaundice and low blood sugar.
Generally, pain and stress hormones rise throughout labour for women without epidurals, while pain, fear, and stress hormones decrease upon administration of epidural analgesia, but  rise again later.
They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing epidurals or by providing anaesthesia (often spinal anaesthesia) for Cesarean section or forceps delivery.
They therefore conclude that "women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish."
A 2011 medical review looked at existing studies and found  that early skin-to-skin contact, sometimes called kangaroo care, resulted in improved breastfeeding outcomes, cardio-respiratory stability, and  a decrease in infant crying.
hyoscine butylbromide) is not formally regarded as augmentation of labour; however, there is weak evidence that they may shorten labour.
The terms postpartum and postnatal are often used to describe this period.
* Fetal compromise such as isoimmunization leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn or oligohydramnios
Heavy blood loss leads to hypovolemic shock, insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated.
According to a 2013 analysis performed commissioned by the New York Times and performed by Truven Healthcare Analytics, the cost of childbirth varies dramatically by country.
Monitoring might show up problems during birthing, but the interpretation and use of monitoring devices is complex and prone to misinterpretation.
They appear to be influenced by fear and anxiety levels, experience with prior childbirth, cultural ideas of childbirth and pain, mobility during labour, and the support received during labour.
In some birthing centers, this may be delayed by 5 minutes or more, or omitted entirely.
In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.
Cervical effacement,  which is the thinning and stretching of the cervix, and cervical dilation occur during the closing weeks of pregnancy and is usually complete or near complete, by the end of the latent phase.
Historically women have been attended and supported by other women during labour and birth.
Maternal-fetal medicine specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.
Most authorities suggest the infant be placed in skin-to-skin contact with the mother for 1 –2 hours immediately after birth, putting routine cares off till later.
Complications in the baby include birth asphyxia.
