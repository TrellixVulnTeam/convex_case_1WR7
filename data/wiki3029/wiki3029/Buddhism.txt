Information of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts.
During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and Mongolia.
Put very briefly, this is the Buddhist doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.
Buddhism applies the dependent arising theory to explain origination of endless cycles of ''dukkha'' and rebirth, through its Twelve Nidānas or "twelve links" doctrine.
The focus of Vipassana meditation is to continuously and thoroughly know impermanence of everything (''annica''), no-Self in anything (''anatta'') and ''dukkha'' teachings of Buddhism.
An alternative scheme used by some scholars divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: Theravada, East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.
That was a period, states Abraham Eraly, of great intellectual ferment, when the Upanishads were composed marking a change in the historical Vedic religion, as well as the emergence of great Sramanic traditions.
Four of these are same as for the lay devotee: no killing, no stealing, no lying, and no intoxicants.
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood)
An example of this is evidenced in Chinese and Pali Buddhist records, such as ''Milindapanha'' and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra.
The texts were part of the ''Tripitakas'', and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the Buddha.
Meditative practices were incorporated from other sramanic movements; the Buddhist texts describe Buddha learnt the practice of the formless dhyana from Brahmanical practices, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.
In addition to these precepts, Buddhist monasteries have hundreds of rules of dhamma conduct, which are a part of its ''patimokkha''.
Contemporary Theravada orthodoxy regards samatha as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation.
Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.
The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering.
It operates like the laws of physics, without external intervention, on every being in all six realms of existence including human beings and gods.
# No sexual activity;
Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically "Theravadin", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings.
Samsara ends if a person attains nirvana, the "blowing out" of the desires and the gaining of true insight into impermanence and non-self reality.
Not all Yogacharins asserted that mind was truly existent; Vasubandhu and Asanga in particular did not.

Some scholars use other schemes.
''madhyamā-pratipad''), a path of spiritual practice to end suffering (''dukkha'') from rebirths in Saṃsāra.
Bruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.
According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the Four Noble Truths became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhānas.
Buddha-nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras''.
The practice of using mantras was adopted from Hinduism, where they were first used in the Vedas.
It states that because Avidyā (ignorance) exists Saṃskāras (karmic formations) exists, because Saṃskāras exists therefore Vijñāna (consciousness) exists, and in a similar manner it links Nāmarūpa (sentient body), Ṣaḍāyatana (six senses), Sparśa (sensory stimulation), Vedanā (feeling), Taṇhā (craving), Upādāna (grasping), Bhava (becoming), Jāti (birth), Jarāmaraṇa (old age, death, sorrow, pain).
In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism.
The texts preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, with parallel Chinese translations, have provided a breakthrough.
The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence.
According to  Carol Anderson, the Theravada-canon lacks "an overriding and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''."

According to Karel Werner and other scholars, devotional worship has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and deep devotion is part of Buddhist traditions starting from the earliest days.
#First dhyana: detach from all sensory desires and sinful states that are a source of unwholesome karma.
However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the ''Shakyas'' community – one that later gave him the title ''Shakyamuni'', and the ''Shakya'' community was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead.
Another core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight.
Hinayana (literally "lesser or inferior vehicle") is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged, but as the Hinayana term is considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are used instead, including Śrāvakayāna, Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism and conservative Buddhism.
These are described in the Pali Canon as trance-like states in the world of desirelessness.
Early Buddhist canonical texts and early biographies of Buddha state that Gautama studied under Vedic teachers, such as Alara Kalama (Sanskrit: Arada Kalama) and Uddaka Ramaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Ramaputra), learning meditation and ancient philosophies, particularly the concept of "nothingness, emptiness" from the former, and "what is neither seen nor unseen" from the latter.

The scholars of Japanese Soto Zen tradition in recent times have critiqued the mainstream Japanese Buddhism for ''dhatu-vada'', that is assuming things have substantiality, a view they assert to be non-Buddhist and "out of tune with the teachings of non-Self and conditioned arising", states Peter Harvey.
The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus ''Pratityasamutpada'' is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.
According to Martin Wilshire, the Sramana tradition evolved in India over two phases, namely Paccekabuddha and Savaka phases, the former being the tradition of individual ascetic and latter of disciples, and that Buddhism and Jainism ultimately emerged from these.
Paul Williams states that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination codes from the early schools of Buddhism.
Rather than Nirvana, Mahayana instead aspires to Buddhahood via the bodhisattva path, a state wherein one remains in the cycle of rebirth to help other beings reach awakening.
The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that vijñāna (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath.
The Buddhist canon also describes and criticizes alternative dhyana practices, which likely mean the pre-existing mainstream meditation practices of Jainism and Hinduism.
Modern scholarship has questioned the ''Milindapanha'' version, expressing doubts whether Menander was Buddhist or just favourably disposed to Buddhist monks.
Craving includes ''kama-tanha'', craving for sense-pleasures; ''bhava-tanha'', craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and ''vibhava-tanha'', craving to not experience the world and painful feelings.

The ''Vinaya Pitaka'' contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist monasteries.
In Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of anattā (Sanskrit: ''anātman'', no-self doctrine) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity.
While Buddhism considers the liberation from Saṃsāra as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists has been to seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana.
