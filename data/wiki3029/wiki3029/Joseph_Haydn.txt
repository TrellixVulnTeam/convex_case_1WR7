During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his Emperor's hymn.
XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.
Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective.

There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes trumpets and timpani.
Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his rosary when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.
The change in Haydn's approach was important in the history of classical music, as other composers were soon following his lead.
The Esterházy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they  appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment:  Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister and Johann Nepomuk Hummel as Konzertmeister in 1804.

Yet his music circulated widely and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe.
The string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but are usually identified instead by their opus numbers, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together; thus for example the string quartet Opus 76, No.
According to later testimony by Michael Kelly and others, the two composers occasionally played in string quartets together.
Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Esterházy family at their remote estate.
He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the ''Hofkapelle'') in Lent and Holy Week.

He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'.
Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterházy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister, Gregor Werner, retaining authority only for church music.

One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister.
Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission.
He spent his summers with the Esterházys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six masses for them.

Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of music theory and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as chorister.
Haydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him.
Of Haydn's new employment contract Jones writes,
Haydn returned to Vienna in 1795.
He is familiarly known as the 'father of the symphony' and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres."
Another friend in Vienna was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom Haydn had met sometime around 1784.
Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancerand that outside of the world of business, in dealings, for example, with relatives and servants and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man.
The people of Hainburg heard him sing treble parts in the church choir.
He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months.
Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing chamber music for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions.

In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as "Sturm und Drang" ("storm and stress").
Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see Papa Haydn and the tale of the "Farewell" Symphony.
He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windmühle, and wrote works for public performance.
Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops.
There is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739 he was brought to the attention of Georg von Reutter, the director of music in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys.
The return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career.

He was also briefly in Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz's employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz.
Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign.
Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus.

These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of "Classical counterpoint" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity.
Haydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother Michael.
Around 1775 the Prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the Prince had built at Esterháza came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year.
In the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his "popular style", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure.

An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of folk or folk-like material, as discussed in the article Haydn and folk music.
This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time.
James Webster writes of Haydn's public character thus: "Haydn's public life exemplified the Enlightenment ideal of the ''honnête homme'' (''honest man''): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other.
His biographer Dies wrote: "...he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman.

The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the six string quartets of Opus 33, announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in "a new and completely special way".
Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with Rebecca Schroeter.
These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Opus 33.
Haydn served as director of the company, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances.
With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day.

Following a trend of the time, Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians.
His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of Mozart and Beethoven, his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition.
Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis.
Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said "I am really just a living clavier."

As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity.
Haydn once remarked that he had worked on ''The Creation'' so long because he wanted it to last.
Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his recapitulation sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive thematic development.
Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales.
According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbours.
Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called "monothematic exposition", in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme.
The Esterházy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762–1790 Nikolaus I) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra.
Charles Burney reviewed the first concert thus: "Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England."
This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality.
Haydn and his wife had a completely unhappy marriage, from which the laws of the time permitted them no escape.
Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from Johann Peter Salomon, a German violinist and  impresario, to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.
This is reflected in the subject matter of ''The Creation'' (1798) and ''The Seasons'' (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind, and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music.
Musically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the ''Surprise'', ''Military'', ''Drumroll'' and ''London'' symphonies; the ''Rider'' quartet; and the "Gypsy Rondo" piano trio.
The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts.
He always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterházy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice' and occasionally in outright fraud.

The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op.
These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from "pure" music and toward the production of comic operas.
He also wrote several of the operas performed (see List of operas by Joseph Haydn) and wrote substitution arias to insert into the operas of other composers.
In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure.
Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the Paris symphonies (1785–1786) and the original orchestral version of The Seven Last Words of Christ (1786), a commission from Cadiz, Spain.
3 is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.
Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street, working in a borrowed studio at the Broadwood piano firm nearby.
Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the Professional Concerts, who recruited Haydn's old pupil Ignaz Pleyel as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.

98 and 102, and the piano trio Hob XV: 23.
A brief work, "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" (the "Emperor's Hymn"; 1797), achieved great success and became "the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War" (Jones); in modern times it became (with different words) the national anthem of Germany.
On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and during the time up to the second London visit was Haydn's pupil.
By the time he arrived on his second journey to England, (1794-1795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene.
It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in Hainburg, that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician.
Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works, which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.

Webster writes: "As regards money, Haydn was so self-interested as to shock both contemporaries and many later authorities&nbsp;....
Despite this backbreaking workload, the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn.

Like Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed.
Haydn's job title under Count Morzin was Kapellmeister, that is, music director.
This single document acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity.
Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg  away; he never again lived with his parents.
He was friend and mentor of Mozart, a teacher of Beethoven, and the older brother of composer Michael Haydn.
While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it.
