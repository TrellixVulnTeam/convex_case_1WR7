This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, whereby the electrical stimulus is usually an action potential and the mechanical response is contraction.
These alternating waves of circular and longitudinal contractions is called peristalsis, which underlies the creeping movement of earthworms.
For example, a wing muscle of a tethered fly may receive action potentials at a frequency of 3&nbsp;Hz but it is able to beat at a frequency of 120&nbsp;Hz.
Length-tension relationship relates the strength of an isometric contraction to the length of the muscle at which the contraction occurs.
Phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle.
In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner.
A neuromuscular junction is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber.
The power stroke moves the actin filament inwards, thereby shortening the sarcomere.
Autorhythmic muscle cells do not contract, but instead set the pace of contraction for other cardiac muscle cells, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.
Two  ions binds to troponin C on the actin filaments.
The remaining acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is either degraded by active acetylcholine esterase or reabsorbed by the synaptic knob and none is left to replace the degraded acetylcholine.
Smooth muscle forms blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and other areas in the body that produce sustained contractions.
Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity.
This has strong implications for the rate at which muscles can perform mechanical work (power).
Finally, if the frequency of muscle action potentials increases such that the muscle contraction reaches its peak force and plateaus at this level, then the contraction is a ''tetanus''.
In 1952, the term excitation–contraction coupling was coined to describe the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response.
Over the short-term, strength training involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase muscular strength more than training with concentric contractions alone.
In relation to the elbow, a concentric contraction of the biceps would cause the arm to bend at the elbow as the hand moved from the leg to the shoulder (a biceps curl).
The near synchronous activation of thousands of calcium sparks by the action potential causes a cell-wide increase in calcium giving rise to the upstroke of the calcium transient.
The sequence of events that results in the depolarization of the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential is initiated in the cell body of a motor neuron, which is then propagated by saltatory conduction along its axon toward the neuromuscular junction.
In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position.
This increase in calcium activates calcium-sensitive contractile proteins that then use ATP to cause cell shortening.
There are two types of cardiac muscle cells: autorhythmic and contractile.
By mechanisms specific to the muscle type, this depolarization results in an increase in cytosolic calcium that is called a calcium transient.
Bivalves use these muscles to keep their shells closed.
The action potential travels along the surface membrane into T-tubules (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes extracellular  to enter the cell via L-type calcium channels and possibly sodium-calcium exchanger during the early part of the plateau phase.
In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner.
In bivalves, the obliquely striated muscles can maintain tension over long periods without using too much energy.
Myosin then releases ADP but still remains tightly bounded to actin.
It is hypothesized that the maintenance of force results from dephosphorylated "latch-bridges" that slowly cycle and maintain force.
During an eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement while bent and then straightens as the hand moves away from the shoulder.
In a typical circumstance, when a human is exerting a muscle as hard as he/she is consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in that muscle will be firing at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells).
In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons to produce muscle contractions.
In contrast, a muscle contraction is isotonic if muscle length changes but the muscle tension remains the same.
Instead, RyRs are activated by a calcium trigger, which is brought about by the activation of DHPRs.
Single-unit smooth muscle cells contract myogenically, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.
The myosin head then releases the inorganic phosphate and initiates a ''power stroke,'' which generates a force of 2 pN.
This wave of ion movements creates the action potential that spreads from the motor end plate in all directions.
As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones.
The elevation of cytosolic  results in more  binding to calmodulin, which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase.
As  declines back to resting levels, the force declines and relaxation occurs.
This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is 'smoothing out' a movement).
The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) actively pumps  back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
The contractile activity of smooth muscle cells is influenced by multiple inputs such as spontaneous electrical activity, neural and hormonal inputs, local changes in chemical composition, and stretch.
During an eccentric contraction of the triceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement straight and then bends as the hand moves towards the shoulder.
This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon&mdash;the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body.
Unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells lack troponin, even though they contain the thin filament protein tropomyosin and other notable proteins – caldesmon and calponin.
Intracellular calcium concentration drops and troponin complex returns over the active site of the actin filament, ending contraction.
Eccentric contractions normally occur as a braking force in opposition to a concentric contraction to protect joints from damage.
Skeletal and cardiac muscles are called striated muscle because of their striped appearance under a microscope, which is due to the highly organized alternating pattern of A bands and I bands.
The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched – force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum.
These flight muscles are called fibrillar muscles because they contain myofibrils that are thick and conspicuous.
This causes the removal of  ions from the troponin.
When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called ''negatives''.
Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the sodium-calcium exchanger and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase and/or taken up by the mitochondria.
Unblocking the rest of the actin binding sites allows the two myosin heads to close and myosin to bind strongly to actin.
In an earthworm that is moving through a soil, for example, contractions of circular and longitudinal muscles occur reciprocally while the coelomic fluid serves as a hydroskeleton by maintaining turgidity of the earthworm.
This occurs when a muscle's force of contraction matches the total load on the muscle.
Further, cardiac muscle tend to exhibit diad (or dyad) structures, rather than triads.
The sliding filament theory describes a process used by muscles to contract.
The increase in  is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases  in a positive feedback physiological response.
At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus removing most  from the cell back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
These two fundamental properties of muscle have numerous biomechanical consequences, including limiting running speed, strength, and jumping distance and height.
Once another ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head will again detach from actin and another crossbridges cycle occurs.
The remainder of the actin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin.
A remarkable feature of these muscles is that they do not require stimulation for each muscle contraction.
Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain constant when the muscle is active during locomotor activity.
This decrease is minimal for small deviations, but the tension drops off rapidly as the length deviates further from the ideal.
A concentric contraction of the triceps would change the angle of the joint in the opposite direction, straightening the arm and moving the hand towards the leg.
This allows the heart muscles to relax to allow for ventricular filling.
The active pumping of  ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils.
Smooth and cardiac muscle contractions are myogenic and can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.
Termination of crossbridge cycling (and leaving the muscle in latch-state) occurs when myosin light chain phosphatase removes the phosphate groups from the myosin heads.
Unlike single-unit smooth muscle cells, multi-unit smooth muscle cells are found in the muscle of the eye and in the base of hair follicles.
These action potentials are generated by the influx of  extracellular , and not .
Note that the sarcoplasmic reticulum has a large calcium buffering capacity partially due to a calcium-binding protein called calsequestrin.
An isometric contraction of a muscle generates tension without changing length.
When muscle tension changes without any corresponding changes in muscle length, the muscle contraction is described as isometric.
Acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the neuromuscular junction.
During virtually any routine movement, eccentric contractions assist in keeping motions smooth, but can also slow rapid movements such as a punch or throw.
Conversely, postganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine, which bind to adrenergic receptors that are also metabotropic.
This rapid fluctuation is called the end-plate potential  The voltage-gated ion channels of the sarcolemma next to the end plate open in response to the end plate potential.
Because these cells are linked together by gap junctions, they are able to contract as a syncytium.
The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes (involving conformational changes that allosterically activates the ryanodine receptors).
It was independently developed by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson in 1954.
If the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric.
A number of kinases such as rho kinase, ZIP kinase, and protein kinase C are believed to participate in the sustained phase of contraction, and  flux may be significant.
Skeletal muscle constitutes the majority of muscle mass in the body and is responsible for locomotor activity.
Muscles undergoing heavy eccentric loading suffer greater damage when overloaded (such as during muscle building or strength training exercise) as compared to concentric loading.
At the end of the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, leaving myosin attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin.
Smooth muscles can be divided into two subgroups: single-unit (unitary) and multi-unit.
Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, which is explained by the sliding filament theory.
'''Muscle contraction''' is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers.
The calcium-calmodulin-myosin light-chain kinase complex phosphorylates myosin on the 20 kilodalton (kDa) myosin light chains on amino acid residue-serine 19, initiating contraction and activating the myosin ATPase.
The membrane potential then becomes hyperpolarized when potassium exits and is then adjusted back to the resting membrane potential.
Furthermore, if the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric.
Eccentric contractions are being researched for their ability to speed rehabilitation of weak or injured tendons.
Summation can be achieved in two ways: ''frequency summation'' and ''multiple fiber summation''.
The brain sends electrochemical signals through the nervous system to the motor neuron that innervates several muscle fibers.
The  ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the  ion concentration in the sarcoplasm.
In annelids such as earthworms and leeches, circular and longitudinal muscles cells form the body wall of these animals and are responsible for their movement.
When stretched or shortened beyond this (whether due to the action of the muscle itself or by an outside force), the maximum active tension generated decreases.
While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to overtraining, moderate training may confer protection against injury.
Excitation–contraction coupling is the process by which a muscular action potential in the muscle fiber causes the myofibrils to contract.
As the ryanodine receptors open,  is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the local junctional space, which then diffuses into the bulk cytoplasm to cause a calcium spark.
As a result, the front end of the animal moves forward.
The time between a stimulus to the motor nerve and the subsequent contraction of the innervated muscle is called the '''latent period''', which usually takes about 10 ms and is caused by the time taken for nerve action potential to propagate, the time for chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction, then the subsequent steps in excitation-contraction coupling.
Due to the presence of elastic proteins within a muscle cell (such as titin) and extracellular matrix, as the muscle is stretched beyond a given length, there is an entirely passive tension, which opposes lengthening.
At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that  does not have to leave the cell entirely.
Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone.
When the circular muscles in the anterior segments contract, the anterior portion of animal's body begins to constrict radially, which pushes the incompressible coelomic fluid forward and increasing the length of the animal.
Part of training for rapid movements such as pitching during baseball involves reducing eccentric braking allowing a greater power to be developed throughout the movement.
As a result, the sarcolemma reverses polarity and its voltage quickly jumps from the resting membrane potential of -90mV to as high as +75mV as sodium enters.
In '''multiple fiber summation''', if the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first.
For example, one expends more energy going up a flight of stairs than going down the same flight.
A twitch is a single contraction and relaxation cycle produced by an action potential within the muscle fiber itself.
Each myosin head has two binding sites: one for ATP and another for actin.
The termination of muscle contraction is followed by '''muscle relaxation''', which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state.
If another muscle action potential were to be produced before the complete relaxation of a muscle twitch, then the next twitch will simply sum onto the previous twitch, thereby producing a ''summation''.
If action potentials stop arriving, then acetylcholine ceases to be released from the terminal bouton.
The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation–contraction coupling takes place.
This  influx causes a small local increase in intracellular .
A muscle contraction is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same.
Thus, the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin filaments and contraction ceases.
Multi-unit smooth muscle cells contract by being separately stimulated by nerves of the autonomic nervous system.
With the ATP hydrolyzed, the cocked myosin head now contains ADP + Pi.
An enzyme, phospholamban, serves as a brake for the ATPase.
A crossbridge is a myosin projection, consisting of two myosin heads, that extends from the thick filaments.
Combined together, there is a strong resistance to lengthening an active muscle far beyond the peak of active tension.
Exercise featuring a heavy eccentric load can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and delayed onset muscle soreness one to two days after training.
The binding of ATP to a myosin head detaches myosin from actin, thereby allowing myosin to bind to another actin molecule.
In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.
Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament toward the centre of the sarcomere.
Muscles operate with greatest active tension when close to an ideal length (often their resting length).
The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the muscle relaxes.
In skeletal muscle, excitation–contraction coupling relies on a direct coupling between key proteins, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release channel (identified as the ryanodine receptor, RyR) and voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (identified as dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs).
This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release  and gives rise to calcium sparks ( sparks).
Some types of smooth muscle cells are able to generate their own action potentials spontaneously, which usually occur following a pacemaker potential or a slow wave potential.
The mechanism for muscle contraction evaded scientists for years and requires continued research and updating.
This occurs throughout the length of the muscle, generating a force at the origin and insertion, causing the muscle to shorten and changing the angle of the joint.
Hence, they are sometimes called ''asynchronous muscles'' because the number of contractions in these muscles do not correspond (or synchronize) with the number of action potentials.
In contrast, contractile muscle cells constitute the majority of the heart muscle and are able to contract.
But if the muscle length lengthens, then the contraction is eccentric.
It is the site in which a motor neuron transmits a signal to a muscle fiber to initiate muscle contraction.
Although smooth muscle contractions are myogenic, the rate and strength of their contractions can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.
As the front end of the earthworm becomes anchored and the circular muscles in the anterior segments become relaxed, a wave of longitudinal muscle contractions passes backwards, which pulls the rest of animal's trailing body forward.
It is a cycle of repetitive events that cause a thin filament to slide over a thick filament and generate tension in the muscle.
Instead, the optimal shortening velocity for power generation is approximately one-third of maximum shortening velocity.
Unlike skeletal muscle, excitation–contraction coupling in cardiac muscle is thought to depend primarily on a mechanism called calcium-induced calcium release.
A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required.
A lack of ATP would result in the rigor state characteristic of rigor mortis.
This is in contrast to the contractile activity of skeletal muscle cells, which relies on a single neural input.
From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above).
Cardiac muscle make up the heart, which pumps blood.
Single-unit smooth muscle cells can be found in the gut and blood vessels.
Physiologically, this contraction is not uniform across the sarcomere; the central position of the thick filaments becomes unstable and can shift during contraction.
The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament.
Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: force and length.
Desmin, titin, and other z-line proteins are involved in eccentric contractions, but their mechanism is poorly understood in comparison to crossbridge cycling in concentric contractions.
During contraction of muscle, rapidly cycling crossbridges form between activated actin and phosphorylated myosin, generating force.
The  released into the cytosol binds to Troponin C by the actin filaments, to allow crossbridge cycling, producing force and, in some situations, motion.
However the actions of elastic proteins such as titin are hypothesised to maintain uniform tension across the sarcomere and pull the thick filament into a central position.
Force–velocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates.
Excitation–contraction coupling can be dysregulated in many diseases.Though excitation–contraction coupling has been known for over half a century, it is still an active area of biomedical research.
Force itself can be differentiated as either tension or load.
When  is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again.
Postganglionic nerve fibers of parasympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) on smooth muscle cells.
Excitation–contraction coupling occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscle cell results in a muscle action potential, which spreads across the cell surface and into the muscle fiber's network of T-tubules, thereby depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber.
Once attached, the ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, which uses the released energy to move into the "cocked position" whereby it binds weakly to a part of the actin binding site.
The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000  sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration.
These receptors are metabotropic, or G-protein coupled receptors that initiate a second messenger cascade.
The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of action potentials.
Since power is equal to force times velocity, the muscle generates no power at either isometric force (due to zero velocity) or maximal velocity (due to zero force).
The  influx causes synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft between the motor neuron terminal and the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscle fiber.
Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time.
Achilles tendinitis  and patellar tendonitis  (also known as jumper's knee or patellar tendonosis) have been shown to benefit from high-load eccentric contractions.
Rather than working to pull a joint in the direction of the muscle contraction, the muscle acts to decelerate the joint at the end of a movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load.
In the case of some reflexes, the signal to contract can originate in the spinal cord through a feedback loop with the grey matter.
Other actions such as locomotion, breathing, and chewing have a reflex aspect to them: the contractions can be initiated both consciously or unconsciously.
The two sources for cytosolic  in smooth muscle cells are the extracellular  entering through calcium channels and the  ions that are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
During a concentric contraction, a muscle is stimulated to contract according to the sliding filament theory.
During a concentric contraction, muscle fibers slide across each other, pulling the Z-lines together.
Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in muscles that contract during locomotor activity.
Though the proteins involved are similar, the DHPR and RyR (type 2) are not physically coupled.
During an eccentric contraction, the filaments slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known.
Intracellular calcium is taken up by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin.
In skeletal muscles, muscle tension is at its greatest when the muscle is stretched to an intermediate length as described by the length-tension relationship.
As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger.
Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscles contractions occur as a result of conscious effort originating in the brain.
The general scheme is that an action potential arrives to depolarize the cell membrane.
DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma (which includes the surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubules), while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane.
In '''frequency summation''', the force exerted by the skeletal muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers.
In isotonic contraction, the tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in muscle length.
Invertebrates such as annelids, mollusks, and nematodes, possess obliquely striated muscles, which contain bands of thick and thin filaments that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles.
The mechanisms of contraction in these muscle tissues are similar to those in skeletal muscle tissues.
As such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle.
Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells occurs when an action potential is initiated by pacemaker cells in the Sinoatrial node or Atrioventricular node and conducted to all cells in the heart via gap junctions.
The sliding filament theory was independently developed by Andrew F. Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson.
A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time.
During this period, there is a rapid burst of energy utilization as measured by oxygen consumption.
