The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe.
This instrument played well in the middle register with a loud, shrill sound, so it was given the name ''clarinetto'' meaning "little trumpet" (from ''clarino'' + ''-etto'').
The popular Brazilian music styles of choro and samba use the clarinet.
concert middle C, on a piccolo clarinet), though some B clarinets go down to E3 to enable them to match the range of the A clarinet.
The reed is on the underside of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure).
The lower-pitched clarinets sound more "mellow" (less bright), and the C clarinet—being the highest and therefore brightest of the three—fell out of favour as the other two clarinets could cover its range and their sound was considered better.
Harmonics are caused by factors including: the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the clarinet reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening for part of the wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave) and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the clarinet bore.
systems, for example.
It is enjoying a resurgence in popular musical styles such as Klezmer; as an instrument in schools, and in more historically accurate interpretations of the classical and Romantic repertoire such as the First and Fifth Symphonies of Beethoven.
This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system.
From the time of Mozart, many composers began to favour the mellower, lower pitched instruments and the timbre of the 'C' instrument may have been considered too bright.
Early clarinets did not play well in the lower register, so players continued to play the chalumeaux for low notes.
The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally vibrating at.
These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.
This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.
The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.
Later models had a mellower tone than the originals.
The middle register is known as the ''clarion'' register (sometimes in the U.S.A. as the ''clarino'' register from the Italian)  and spans just over an octave (from written B above middle C (B4) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)); it is the dominant range for most members of the clarinet family.
The modern clarinetist has a diverse palette of "acceptable" tone qualities to choose from.
However, many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on B or E clarinets, which are often of better quality and more prevalent and accessible.
(Soprano clarinet in B)
# The original compression wave, now greatly reinforced by the second 'puff' of air, sets off on another two trips down the pipe (travelling 4 pipe lengths in total) before the cycle is repeated again.
Common combinations are:
This is probably the origin of the Italian ''clarinetto'', itself a diminutive of ''clarino'', and consequently of the European equivalents such as ''clarinette'' in French or the German ''Klarinette''.
The ligature fastens the reed to the mouthpiece.
The main body of most clarinets is divided into the ''upper joint'', the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the ''lower joint'' with holes and most keys operated by the right hand.
The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Aerosmith, Billy Joel, and Tom Waits have also all used clarinet on occasion.
The B soprano was the most common instrument, but a few early jazz musicians such as Louis Nelson Delisle and Alcide Nunez preferred the C soprano, and many New Orleans jazz brass bands have used E soprano.
It was commonly used in early jazz and swing.
Clarinets have the largest pitch range of common woodwinds.
The English form ''clarinet'' is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic ''clarionet'' appears from 1784 until the early years of the 20th century.
The bottom of the clarinet's written range is defined by the keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet.
Many works of chamber music have also been written for the clarinet.
Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone.
A skilled performer can use his or her embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or to produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz.
Clarinet bodies have been made from a variety of materials including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory.
Some klezmer musicians prefer Albert system clarinets.
* Trio d'anches, or ''trio of reeds'' consists of oboe, clarinet, and bassoon.
This means that it cannot be reinforced and so would die away.
Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part.
The clarinet was originally a central instrument in jazz, beginning with the New Orleans players in the 1910s.
Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, do use vibrato in classical music.
The highest notes on a clarinet can have a shrill piercing quality and can be difficult to tune accurately.
Each of these addressed—and often improved—issues of particular "weak" tones, or simplified awkward fingerings, but none has caught on widely among players, and the Boehm system remains the standard, to date.
At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.
While the clarinet in C began to fall out of general use around 1850, some composers continued to write C parts after this date, e.g., Bizet's Symphony in C (1855), Tchaikovsky's Symphony No.
Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it improves the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register.
Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register.
The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear.
Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.
A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key, or speaker key: clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register "the break".
The instrument is equally famous in Turkey, especially the lower pitched clarinet in G. The western European clarinet crossed via Turkey to Arabic music, where it is widely used in Arabic pop, especially if the intention of the arranger is to imitate the Turkish style.
Adjusting the angle of the bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics).
The double-reed zurna was the dominant woodwind instrument before the clarinet arrived in the country, although many Greeks regard the clarinet as a native instrument.
Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it.
It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes.
The ''reed'' is attached to the ''mouthpiece'' by the ''ligature'', and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth.
Since the middle of the 19th century the bass clarinet (nowadays invariably in B but with extra keys to extend the register down a few notes) has become an essential addition to the orchestra.
The clarinet has proved to be an exceptionally flexible instrument, equally at home in the classical repertoire as in concert bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, and jazz.
resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as G7 exist.
Other ligature materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.
Petroloukas Chalkias is a famous clarinetist in this genre.
Advances in playing technique and the instrument's mechanism meant that players could play parts for the D instrument on their E thus making this instrument more and more expendable.
Theobald Boehm did not directly invent the key system of the clarinet.
Clarinets were soon accepted into orchestras.
Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet.
Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these higher notes.
The tone quality can vary greatly with the musician, the music, the instrument, the mouthpiece, and the reed.
A key at the side of the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower.
Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage.
''Clarion'', ''clarin'' and the Italian ''clarino'' are all derived from the medieval term ''claro'' which referred to an early form of trumpet.
A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles.
The '''clarinet''' is a musical-instrument family belonging to the group known as the woodwind instruments.
By that time, an interest in Dixieland or traditional New Orleans jazz had revived; Pete Fountain was one of the best known performers in this genre.
The clarinet is prominent in Bulgarian wedding music, an offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music.
Nonetheless Stravinsky included both the D and E clarinets in his instrumentation for The Rite Of Spring
During the late baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, ''clarion'' register.
Finally, the flared end is known as the ''bell''.
# The mouthpiece and reed are surrounded by the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal.
6 (1906), and Richard Strauss deliberately reintroduced it to take advantage of its brighter tone, as in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' (1911).
Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.
The orchestra frequently includes two clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually equipped with a pair of standard clarinets in B and A, and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times over the course of a piece or even, less commonly, of a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms 3rd symphony).
Original Denner clarinets had two keys, and could play a chromatic scale, but various makers added more keys to get improved tuning, easier fingerings, and a slightly larger range.
This "hourglass" shape, although not visible to the naked eye, helps to correct the pitch/scale discrepancy between the chalumeau and clarion registers (perfect 12th).
Also in Turkish folk music, a clarinet-like woodwind instrument, the sipsi, is used.
This is because the opening is very small compared to the size of the tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).
* Clarinet trio; Clarinet, piano, and another instrument (for example, string instrument or voice)
Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about one and a half octaves.
Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone clarinet, with two parallel bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated using the same keywork and a valve to switch from one bore to the other.
For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e.
There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.
The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).
In concert bands, clarinets are an important part of the instrumentation.
With the invention of the airtight pad, and as key technology improved and more keys were added to woodwinds, the need for clarinets in multiple musical keys was reduced.
Orchestral players using the A and B instruments in the same concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) for both (see 'usage' below).
Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.
Duke Ellington, active from the 1920s to the 1970s, used the clarinet as lead instrument in his works, with several players of the instrument (Barney Bigard, Jimmy Hamilton, and Russell Procope) spending a significant portion of their careers in his orchestra.
By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave, or like the ocarina and tonette, do not overblow at all.
The instrument uses a single reed made from the cane of ''Arundo donax'', a type of grass.
Most clarinetists buy manufactured reeds, although many make adjustments to these reeds and some make their own reeds from cane "blanks".
Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau.
Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.
These days the most popular clarinet is the B clarinet.
It is frequently used in orchestral and chamber music, especially of the nineteenth century.
Most alto and bass clarinets have an extra key to allow a (written) E3.
Other key systems have been developed, many built around modifications to the basic Boehm system:  Full Boehm; Mazzeo,; McIntyre; NX; and Reform-Boehm.
It was airtight and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes.
Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used.
This numbering system is not standardized—reeds with the same hardness number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models.
This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is the same as that of a wooden clarinet.
The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question.
Ligatures are often made out of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold.
Prominent contemporary players include Paulo Moura, Naylor 'Proveta' Azevedo, Paulo Sérgio dos Santos and Cuban born Paquito D'Rivera.
In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E or D soprano clarinets, basset horn, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and/or contrabass clarinet.
However, the clarinet in A, just a semitone lower, is commonly used in orchestral music.
One of the most renowned Macedonian clarinet players is Tale Ognenovski, who gained worldwide fame for his virtuosity.
The A clarinet and B clarinet have nearly the same bore, and use the same mouthpiece.
Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again.
Difficult key signatures and numerous accidentals were thus largely avoided.
Clarinets with few keys cannot therefore easily play chromatically, limiting any such instrument to a few closely related key signatures.
On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.
It is sometimes used in orchestras.
American players Alphonse Picou, Larry Shields, Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Sidney Bechet were all pioneers of the instrument in jazz.
Traditional dance music, wedding music and laments include a clarinet soloist and quite often improvisations.
In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical.
Sometimes referred to (mostly in Europe) as the tenor clarinet.
The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.
The modern orchestral standard of using soprano clarinets in both B and A has to do partly with the history of the instrument, and partly with acoustics, aesthetics, and economics.
According to Johann Gottfried Walther, writing in 1732, the reason for the name is that "it sounded from far off not unlike a trumpet".
four times the length of the pipe).
While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet  may hold a clue to its name,  other factors may have been involved.
There have also been soprano clarinets in C, A, and B with curved barrels and bells marketed under the names saxonette, claribel, and clariphon.
When air is blown through the opening between the reed and the mouthpiece facing, the reed vibrates and produces the instrument's sound.
(Soprano clarinet in C)
Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes.
The current Boehm key system consists of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key just above the thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb.
Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre.
Mozart (d. 1791) liked the sound of the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.
Many clarinet concertos have been written to showcase the instrument, with the concerti by Mozart, Copland, and Weber being well known.
Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute.
Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.
A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced.
Used in clarinet choirs and is common in concert bands.
(Sopranino clarinet in D)
The trumpet parts that required this speciality were known by the term ''clarino'' and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves.
* Wind quintet, consists of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn.
The clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB octo-contrabass to the A piccolo clarinet.
The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics, a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals.
Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, which was soon abandoned.
In the same way that a flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate.
As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly.
The clarion register is brighter and sweet, like a trumpet (''clarion'') heard from afar.
This involves more keywork than is necessary on instruments that "overblow" at the octave—oboes, flutes, bassoons, and saxophones, for example, which need only twelve notes before overblowing.
Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used.
The relatively late evolution of the clarinet (when compared to other orchestral woodwinds) has left solo repertoire from the Classical period and later, but few works from the Baroque era.
Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well.
The left thumb operates both a ''tone hole'' and the ''register key''.
Swing clarinetists such as Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman led successful big bands and smaller groups from the 1930s onward.
The altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill.
Contrabass clarinet (also called B subcontrabass or double-bass clarinet)
The intricate key organization that makes this range possible can make the playability of some passages awkward.
The word ''clarinet'' may have entered the English language via the French ''clarinette'' (the feminine diminutive of Old French ''clarin'' or ''clarion''), or from Provençal ''clarin'', "oboe".
The cylindrical bore is primarily responsible for the clarinet's distinctive timbre, which varies between its three main registers, known as the chalumeau, clarion, and altissmo.
It is used in chamber music and concert bands, and occasionally, if rarely, in orchestras.
In 1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder.
This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria.
The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to the reflection of the rarefaction wave.
* Clarinet quartet: three B clarinets and bass clarinet, two B clarinets, alto clarinet and bass, and other possibilities such as the use of a basset horn, especially in European classical works.
The B instrument remains dominant in concert bands and in jazz.
115) is a notable example.
Such instruments are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier.
Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function as if it were larger, but its main function is to allow the air column to follow the curve up through the tone hole (surface tension) instead of "blowing past" it under the increasingly directional frequencies of the upper registers.
The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians.
In Greece the clarinet (usually referred to as "κλαρίνο"—"clarino") is prominent in traditional music, especially in central, northwest and northern Greece (Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia).
EEE and BBB octocontra-alto and octocontrabass clarinets have also been built.
Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla.
The clarinet is widely used as a solo instrument.
On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key on the back of the clarinet and the pad on the front.
Bob Wilber, active since the 1950s, is a more eclectic jazz clarinetist, playing in several classic jazz styles.
1 (1878), Brahms' Symphony No.&nbsp;4 (1885), Mahler's Symphony No.
* Clarinet and piano (including clarinet sonatas)
These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale.
The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the ''thumb-rest''.
Gianluigi Trovesi ).
Undercutting means chamfering the bottom edge of tone holes inside the bore.
The differences in instruments and geographical isolation of players in different countries led to the development, from the last part of the 18th century onwards, of several different schools of clarinet playing.
For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant.
Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the 8th (octave) when its thumb/register hole is pinched open while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows on the 12th.
It is used in concert bands, contemporary music, and enjoys, along with the B clarinet, a considerable rôle in jazz.
All three registers have characteristically different sounds.
The low (chalumeau) register of the clarinet spans a twelfth (an octave plus a perfect fifth), so the clarinet needs keys/holes to produce all nineteen notes in that range.
The modern clarinet developed from a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau.
As clarinets improved, the chalumeau fell into disuse, and these notes became known as the ''chalumeau register''.
Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band).
Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave) but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice the original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction.
These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet.
The clarinet is uncommon, but not unheard of in rock music.
The classical clarinet of Mozart's day typically had eight finger holes and five keys.
Its greater size and consequently lower pitch give it a rich, dark sonority capable of greater resonance than the soprano instruments, but with less projection than the larger bass clarinet.
The body of a modern soprano clarinet is equipped with numerous ''tone holes'' of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys.
