His protagonists were often young American women facing oppression or abuse, and as his secretary Theodora Bosanquet remarked in her monograph ''Henry James at Work'':
The letters range from the "mere twaddle of graciousness" to serious discussions of artistic, social and personal issues.
In all he wrote about a dozen plays, most of which went unproduced.
*''Daisy Miller'' (1878), novella
In a letter to Howard Sturgis, following a long visit, James refers jocularly to their "happy little congress of two" and in letters to Hugh Walpole he pursues convoluted jokes and puns about their relationship, referring to himself as an elephant who "paws you oh so benevolently" and winds about Walpole his "well meaning old trunk".
The first period of James's fiction, usually considered to have culminated in ''The Portrait of a Lady'', concentrated on the contrast between Europe and America.
Howells wrote that realism found "its chief exemplar in Mr. James... A novelist he is not, after the old fashion, or after any fashion but his own."
His other plays written at this time were not produced.
Therefore I think that—if you want it made clear to the meanest intelligence—I love you more than I love Others."
In 1913 he wrote his autobiographies, ''A Small Boy and Others'', and ''Notes of a Son and Brother''.
In 1878 "Daisy Miller" established his fame on both sides of the Atlantic.
*''A Passionate Pilgrim'' (1871), novella
A complete edition of James's letters began publication in 2006, edited by Pierre Walker and Greg Zacharias.
The "late James" style was ably parodied by Max Beerbohm in "The Mote in the Middle Distance".
The family first lived in Albany and then moved to Fourteenth Street in New York City when James was still a young boy.
His first published work was a review of a stage performance, "Miss Maggie Mitchell in ''Fanchon the Cricket,''" published in 1863.
Some of these people befriend Milly with honourable motives, while others are more self-interested.
During a fourteen-month trip through Europe in 1869-70 he met Ruskin, Dickens, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, and George Eliot.
*"The Figure in the Carpet" (1896), short story
In 1869 he settled in London.
More than ten thousand of his personal letters are extant, and over three thousand have been published in a large number of collections.
Dupee had not had access to the James family papers and worked principally from James's published memoir of his older brother, William, and the limited collection of letters edited by Percy Lubbock, heavily weighted toward James's last years.
He is best known for a number of novels showing Americans encountering Europe and Europeans.
After the failure of ''Guy Domville'' James was near despair and thoughts of death plagued him.
Still, he produced a number of very short stories in which he achieved notable compression of sometimes complex subjects.
The years spent on dramatic works were not entirely a loss.
In the fall of 1875 he moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris.
After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he did war work.
In Paris he met Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Maupassant, Turgenev, and others.
Their stylistic methods influenced his own work in the years to come.
His many letters to the many young gay men among his close male friends are more forthcoming.
The audience for these serialized novels was largely made up of middle-class women, and James struggled to fashion serious literary work within the strictures imposed by editors' and publishers' notions of what was suitable for young women to read.
James stated in his autobiographical books that Milly was based on Minny Temple, his beloved cousin who died at an early age of tuberculosis.
In 1877 he first visited Wenlock Abbey in Shropshire, home of his friend Charles Milnes Gaskell whom he had met through Henry Adams.
In 1884 James made another visit to Paris.
He worked for a living, however, and lacked the experiences of select schools, university, and army service, the common bonds of masculine society.
In addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel, biography, autobiography, and criticism, and wrote plays.
James was born at 2 Washington Place in New York City on 15 April 1843.
David Lodge also wrote a long essay about writing about Henry James in his collection ''The Year of Henry James: The Story of a Novel''.
In 1906–1910 he published ''The American Scene'' and edited the "New York Edition", a twenty-four volume collection of his works.
In many of his tales, characters seem to exemplify alternate futures and possibilities, as most markedly in "The Jolly Corner", in which the protagonist and a ghost-doppelganger live alternate American and European lives; and in others, like ''The Ambassadors,'' an older James seems fondly to regard his own younger self facing a crucial moment.
He died on February 28, 1916, in Chelsea, London.
In ''The Portrait of a Lady'' (1881) James concluded the first phase of his career with a novel that remains his most popular piece of long fiction.
I yearn over you, but I yearn in vain; & your long silence really breaks my heart, mystifies, depresses, almost alarms me, to the point even of making me wonder if poor unconscious & doting old Célimare Jones's pet name for James has 'done' anything, in some dark somnambulism of the spirit, which has&nbsp;... given you a bad moment, or a wrong impression, or a 'colourable pretext'&nbsp;...
James was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916.
Critics have jokingly described three phases in the development of James's prose: "James I, James II, and The Old Pretender."
He converted his novel ''The American'' into a play that enjoyed modest returns in the early 1890s.
(Edel conjectured that Woolson was in love with James and killed herself in part because of his coldness, but Woolson's biographers have strongly objected to Edel's account.)
His account therefore moved directly from James's childhood, when he trailed after his older brother, to elderly invalidism.
To his homosexual friend Howard Sturgis, James could write: "I repeat, almost to indiscretion, that I could live with you.
Indeed, he might have influenced stream-of-consciousness writers such as Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.
"At last—for the first time—I live!"
The following narratives are representative of James's achievement in the shorter forms of fiction.
James's correspondents included celebrated contemporaries like Robert Louis Stevenson, Edith Wharton and Joseph Conrad, along with many others in his wide circle of friends and acquaintances.
James's first payment was for an appreciation of Sir Walter Scott's novels, written for the ''North American Review''.
He wrote fiction and non-fiction pieces for ''The Nation'' and ''Atlantic Monthly'', where Fields was editor.
For most of his life James harboured ambitions for success as a playwright.
In 1864 the James family moved to Boston, Massachusetts to be near William, who had enrolled first in the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard and then in the medical school.
At several points in his career James wrote plays, beginning with one-act plays written for periodicals in 1869 and 1871 and a dramatization of his popular novella ''Daisy Miller'' in 1882.
He wrote to Howells that the books had hurt his career rather than helped because they had "reduced the desire, and demand, for my productions to zero".
James was particularly interested in what he called the "beautiful and blest ''nouvelle''", or the longer form of short narrative.
As he moved into the last phase of his career he found ways to adapt dramatic techniques into the novel form.
In the autumn of 1861 Henry received an injury, probably to his back, while fighting a fire.
His method of writing from a character's point of view allowed him to explore issues related to consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting.
The play received moderately good reviews and had a modest run of four weeks before being taken off to make way for Oscar Wilde's ''The Importance of Being Earnest'', which Alexander thought would have better prospects for the coming season.
"Here I am then in the Eternal City," he wrote to his brother William.
James claimed that a text must first and foremost be realistic and contain a representation of life that is recognisable to its readers.
Other critics such as E.&nbsp;M. Forster complained about what they saw as James's squeamishness in the treatment of sex and other possibly controversial material, or dismissed his style as difficult and obscure, relying heavily on extremely long sentences and excessively latinate language.
In his ''Notebooks'' he maintained that his theatrical experiment benefited his novels and tales by helping him dramatise his characters' thoughts and emotions.
*''The Aspern Papers'' (1888), novella
Henry studied primarily with tutors and briefly attended a few schools while the family traveled in Europe.
During this early period in his career he was influenced by Hawthorne.
His education was calculated by his father to expose him to many influences, primarily scientific and philosophical; it was described as "extraordinarily haphazard and promiscuous."
*"A Tragedy of Error" (1864), short story
Matthiessen, who wrote: "Instead of being crushed by the collapse of his hopes for the theatre... he felt a resurgence of new energy."
In its intense focus on the consciousness of his major characters, James's later work foreshadows extensive developments in 20th century fiction.
His friend Turgenev died in 1883.
Critical reaction and sales were poor.
The style of these novels is generally straightforward and, though personally characteristic, well within the norms of 19th century fiction.
He lived in rented rooms but was able to join gentlemen's clubs that had libraries and where he could entertain male friends.
His third novel from the 1880s was ''The Tragic Muse.''
Leon Edel argued in his psychoanalytic biography that James was traumatized by the opening night uproar that greeted ''Guy Domville'', and that it plunged him into a prolonged depression.
Jorge Luis Borges wrote about him, "Despite the scruples and delicate complexities of James his work suffers from a major defect: the absence of life."
There he met again with Zola, Daudet, and Goncourt.
Beyond his fiction, James was one of the more important literary critics in the history of the novel.
''The Outcry'' was a best-seller in the United States when it was published in 1911.
Single paragraphs began to run for page after page, in which an initial noun would be succeeded by pronouns surrounded by clouds of adjectives and prepositional clauses, far from their original referents, and verbs would be deferred and then preceded by a series of adverbs.
James's letters to expatriate American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen have attracted particular attention.
Gordon Fraser, meanwhile, has suggested that the study was part of a more commercial effort by James to introduce himself to British readers as Hawthorne's natural successor.
He had been following the careers of the French "realist" or "naturalist" writers, and was increasingly influenced by them.
As more material became available to scholars, including the diaries of contemporaries and hundreds of affectionate and sometimes erotic letters written by James to younger men, the picture of neurotic celibacy gave way to a portrait of a closeted homosexual, although as author Terry Eagleton has stated, "... gay critics debate exactly how repressed his (probable) homosexuality was&nbsp;..."
His works frequently juxtapose characters from the Old World (Europe), embodying a feudal civilization that is beautiful, often corrupt, and alluring, and from the New World (United States), where people are often brash, open, and assertive and embody the virtues—freedom and a more highly evolved moral character—of the new American society.
James explores this clash of personalities and cultures, in stories of personal relationships in which power is exercised well or badly.
The period from 1881 to 1883 was marked by several losses.
In a letter of 6 May 1904, to his brother William, James referred to himself as "always your hopelessly celibate even though sexagenarian Henry".
F. W. Dupee, in several volumes on the James family, originated the theory that he had been in love with his cousin Mary ("Minnie") Temple, but that a neurotic fear of sex kept him from admitting such affections: "James's invalidism&nbsp;... was itself the symptom of some fear of or scruple against sexual love on his part."
Richard Brodhead has suggested that the study was emblematic of James's struggle with Hawthorne's influence, and constituted an effort to place the elder writer "at a disadvantage."
With his wide-ranging artistic interests, James occasionally wrote on the visual arts.
The overall effect could be a vivid evocation of a scene as perceived by a sensitive observer.
In 1910 his brother William died.
Generally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase, ''The Portrait of a Lady'' is described as a psychological novel, exploring the minds of his characters, and almost a work of social science, exploring the differences between Europeans and Americans, the old and the new worlds.
During the years 1890–1893 when he was most engaged with the theater, James wrote a good deal of theatrical criticism and assisted Elizabeth Robins and others in translating and producing Henrik Ibsen for the first time in London.
He also began his first masterpiece, ''The Portrait of a Lady,'' which would appear in 1881.
His parents were Mary Walsh and Henry James, Sr. His father was intelligent, steadfastly congenial, and a lecturer and philosopher who had inherited independent means from his father, an Albany banker and investor.
He pursued his interest in literature and associated with authors and critics William Dean Howells and Charles Eliot Norton in Boston and Cambridge, formed lifelong friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., the future Supreme Court Justice, and with James and Annie Fields, his first professional mentors.
In his classic essay ''The Art of Fiction'' (1884), he argued against rigid prescriptions on the novelist's choice of subject and method of treatment.
James alternated between America and Europe for the first twenty years of his life; eventually he settled in England, becoming a British subject in 1915, one year before his death.
He was furthermore a man whose tastes and interests were, according to the prevailing standards of Victorian era Anglo-American culture, rather feminine, and who was shadowed by the cloud of prejudice that then and later accompanied suspicions of his homosexuality.
James was harshly portrayed by H.&nbsp;G. Wells as a hippopotamus laboriously attempting to pick up a pea that had got into a corner of its cage.
The second period of James's career, which extends from the publication of ''The Portrait of a Lady'' through the end of the nineteenth century, features less popular novels including ''The Princess Casamassima'', published serially in ''The Atlantic Monthly'' in 1885–1886, and ''The Bostonians'', published serially in ''The Century Magazine'' during the same period.
It has been debated whether this change of style was engendered by James' shifting from writing to dictating to a typist, a change made during the composition of ''What Maisie Knew.''
''Roderick Hudson'' (1875) is a Künstlerroman that traces the development of the title character, an extremely talented sculptor.
There Henry became a friend of the painter John La Farge, who introduced him to French literature, and in particular, to Balzac.
He attempted to support himself as a free-lance writer in Rome, and then secured a position as Paris correspondent for the ''New York Tribune'', through the influence of its editor John Hay.
Finally, in his third and last period he returned to the long, serialised novel.
James also wrote sometimes charming, sometimes brooding articles about various places he visited and lived in.
1879-1882 saw the publication of ''The Europeans'', ''Washington Square'', ''Confidence'', and ''The Portrait of a Lady''.
While living in London, James continued to follow the careers of the "French realists", Émile Zola in particular.
After the stresses and disappointment of these efforts James insisted that he would write no more for the theater, but within weeks had agreed to write a curtain-raiser for Ellen Terry.
Both contemporary and modern readers have found the late style difficult and unnecessary; his friend Edith Wharton, who admired him greatly, said that there were passages in his work that were all but incomprehensible.
Rome impressed him profoundly.
1899–1900 saw the publication of ''The Awkward Age'' and ''The Sacred Fount''.
He was introduced to English society by Henry Adams and Charles Milnes Gaskell, the latter introducing him to the Travellers' and the Reform Clubs.
Although he was following the precepts of Zola in his novels of the 80s, their tone and attitude are closer to the fiction of Alphonse Daudet.
These books portray the development of a classic observer who was passionately interested in artistic creation but was somewhat reticent about participating fully in the life around him.
Beginning in the second period, but most noticeably in the third, he increasingly abandoned direct statement in favour of frequent double negatives, and complex descriptive imagery.
The third period of James's career reached its most significant achievement in three novels published just around the start of the 20th century: ''The Wings of the Dove'' (1902), ''The Ambassadors'' (1903), and ''The Golden Bowl'' (1904).
'''Henry James''' ( – ) was an American-born British writer.
He would write, in all, over 200 essays and book, art, and theatre reviews for the magazine.
*''The Pupil'' (1891), short story
His younger sister was Alice.
In 1916 he was awarded the Order of Merit.
Mary came from a wealthy family long settled in New York City, and her sister Katherine lived with the family for an extended period of time.
He corresponded in almost equally extravagant language with his many female friends, writing, for example, to fellow-novelist Lucy Clifford: "Dearest Lucy!
James then largely abandoned his efforts to conquer the stage and returned to his fiction.
William Dean Howells saw James as a representative of a new realist school of literary art which broke with the English romantic tradition epitomised by the works of Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.
He wrote three new plays, two of which were in production when the death of Edward&nbsp;VII on 6 May 1910 plunged London into mourning and theaters closed.
Is there really any sense in it?"
''The Portrait of a Lady'' may be an experiment to see what happens when an idealistic young woman suddenly becomes very rich.
He confessed he got some of his best story ideas from gossip at the dinner table or at country house weekends.
Discouraged by failing health and the stresses of theatrical work, James did not renew his efforts in the theater, but recycled his plays as successful novels.
James regularly rejected suggestions that he marry, and after settling in London proclaimed himself "a bachelor".
(His dramatic works and his experiences with theater are discussed below.)
His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators brought a new depth to narrative fiction.
However these things may be, he loves you as tenderly as ever; nothing, to the end of time, will ever detach him from you, & he remembers those Eleventh St. matutinal ''intimes'' hours, those telephonic matinées, as the most romantic of his life&nbsp;..." His long friendship with American novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, in whose house he lived for a number of weeks in Italy in 1887, and his shock and grief over her suicide in 1894, are discussed in detail in Leon Edel's biography and play a central role in a study by Lyndall Gordon.
From 1890 to 1892, having received a bequest that freed him from magazine publication, he made a strenuous effort to succeed on the London stage, writing a half-dozen plays of which only one, a dramatization of his novel ''The American,'' was produced.
There he established relationships with Macmillan and other publishers, who paid for serial installments that they would later publish in book form.
In 1897–1898 he moved to Rye, Sussex, and wrote "The Turn of the Screw".
In 1886 he published ''The Bostonians'' and ''The Princess Casamassima'', both influenced by the French writers he'd studied assiduously.
He spent a long stay in Italy in 1887.
To his New York friend Mary Cadwalader Jones: "Dearest Mary Cadwalader.
In the late 80s and throughout the 90s James made several trips through Europe.
In particular the gloomy monastic fishponds behind the Abbey are said to have inspired the lake in Turn of the Screw.
The narrative is set mainly in Europe, especially in England and Italy.
In 1860 the family returned to Newport.
In his 1983 book, ''The Novels of Henry James'', Edward Wagenknecht offers an assessment that echoes Theodora Bosanquet's:
He continued to be a prolific writer, producing ''The American'' (1877), ''The Europeans'' (1878), a revision of ''Watch and Ward'' (1878), ''French Poets and Novelists'' (1878), ''Hawthorne'' (1879), and several shorter works of fiction.
James contributed significantly to literary criticism, particularly in his insistence that writers be allowed the greatest possible freedom in presenting their view of the world.
James was one of the great letter-writers of any era.
James met the 27-year-old Andersen in Rome in 1899, when James was 56, and wrote letters to Andersen that are intensely emotional: "I hold you, dearest boy, in my innermost love, & count on your feeling me—in every throb of your soul".
Although the book shows some signs of immaturity—this was James's first serious attempt at a full-length novel—it has attracted favourable comment due to the vivid realisation of the three major characters: Roderick Hudson, superbly gifted but unstable and unreliable; Rowland Mallet, Roderick's limited but much more mature friend and patron; and Christina Light, one of James's most enchanting and maddening femmes fatales.
Dupee used an episode from James's memoir ''A Small Boy and Others,'' recounting a dream of a Napoleonic image in the Louvre, to exemplify James's romanticism about Europe, a Napoleonic fantasy into which he fled.
He stayed in Paris only a year before moving to London.
This novel tells the story of Milly Theale, an American heiress stricken with a serious disease, and her impact on the people around her.
James later called Balzac his "greatest master," and said that he had learned more about the craft of fiction from him than from anyone else.
This period also featured James's celebrated novella, ''The Turn of the Screw''.
He said that he attempted in the novel to wrap her memory in the "beauty and dignity of art".
It is also possible to see many of James's stories as psychological thought-experiments.
*''The Lesson of the Master'' (1888), novella
Edmund Wilson famously compared James's objectivity to Shakespeare's:
He visited America in 1882-1883, then returned to London.
There was a noisy uproar on the opening night, 5 January 1895, with hissing from the gallery when James took his bow after the final curtain, and the author was considerably upset.
This injury, which resurfaced at times throughout his life, made him unfit for military service in the American Civil War.
*''Madame de Mauves'' (1874), novella
He maintained that the widest possible freedom in content and approach would help ensure narrative fiction's continued vitality.
His letters to Walter Berry printed by the Black Sun Press have long been celebrated for their lightly veiled eroticism.
*''The Beast in the Jungle'' (1903), novella
He was afflicted with a stutter and compensated by speaking slowly and deliberately.
The successful later novels, in Edel's view, were the result of a kind of self-analysis, expressed in fiction, which partly freed him from his fears.
In 1870 he published his first novel, ''Watch and Ward''.
How accurate that description might have been is the subject of contention among James's biographers, but the letters to Andersen were occasionally quasi-erotic: "I put, my dear boy, my arm around you, & feel the pulsation, thereby, as it were, of our excellent future & your admirable endowment."
In 1915 he became a British subject.
During 1874 and 1875 he published ''Transatlantic Sketches'', ''A Passionate Pilgrim'', and ''Roderick Hudson''.
As of 2014, eight volumes have been published, covering the period from 1855 to 1880.
Colm Tóibín observed that James "never really wrote about the English very well.
This play was performed for several years by a touring repertory company and had a respectable run in London, but did not earn very much money for James.
Vernon Parrington, composing a canon of American literature, condemned James for having cut himself off from America.
James wrote many valuable critical articles on other novelists; typical is his book-length study of Nathaniel Hawthorne, which has been the subject of critical debate.
James did not share the usual education in Latin and Greek classics.
Very late in life James began a series of autobiographical works: ''A Small Boy and Others'', ''Notes of a Son and Brother'', and the unfinished ''The Middle Years''.
In 1862 Henry attended Harvard Law School, but realized that he was not interested in studying law.
Other biographers and scholars have not accepted this account, however; the more common view being that of F.O.
His ashes were buried in Cambridge cemetery in Massachusetts.
She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates.
Aside from two trips to America, he spent the next three decades—the rest of his life—in Europe.
Perhaps his most valuable contribution was his favourable assessment of fellow expatriate John Singer Sargent, a painter whose critical status has improved markedly in recent decades.
In England he met the leading figures of politics and culture.
He is regarded as one of the key figures of 19th-century literary realism.
During this time he became friends with Robert Louis Stevenson, John Singer Sargent, Edmund Gosse, George du Maurier, Paul Bourget, and Constance Fenimore Woolson.
Meanwhile I can only try to live without you."
