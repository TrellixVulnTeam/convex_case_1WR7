It is therefore believed to be a black hole; it was the first object for which this was widely believed.
High-mass X-ray binaries contain a young, early-type, high-mass donor star which transfers mass by its stellar wind, while low-mass X-ray binaries are semidetached binaries in which gas from a late-type donor star or a white dwarf overflows the Roche lobe and falls towards the neutron star or black hole.
The last such eclipse occurred from 2009–2011, and it is hoped that the extensive observations that will likely be carried out may yield further insights into the nature of this system.
For most of the known visual binary stars one whole revolution has not been observed yet, they are observed to have travelled along a curved path or a partial arc.
The stars have no major effect on each other, and essentially evolve separately.
In extreme cases this event can cause the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger a supernova that destroys the entire star, and is another possible cause for runaways.
This distinction is rarely made in languages other than English.
This is quite distinct from the far more common observations of alternating period increases and decreases explained by the Applegate mechanism.
The bright southern star Acrux, in the Southern Cross, was discovered to be double by Father Fontenay in 1685.
Binary stars that are both visual and spectroscopic binaries are rare, and are a precious source of valuable information when found.
The brighter star of a visual binary is the ''primary'' star, and the dimmer is considered the ''secondary.''
Detecting binaries with these methods requires accurate photometry.
The same mathematics used for ordinary binaries can be applied to infer the mass of the missing companion.
Such a system is known as a double-lined spectroscopic binary (often denoted "SB2").
However, the product of the semi-major axis and the sine of the inclination (i.e.
In some spectroscopic binaries, spectral lines from both stars are visible and the lines are alternately double and single.
Since the evolution of a star is determined by its mass, the process influences the evolution of both companions, and creates stages that cannot be attained by single stars.
An example of such an event is the supernova SN 1572, which was observed by Tycho Brahe.
In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system.
The brightest member, which is the third brightest star in the constellation Cygnus, is actually a close binary itself.
Early examples include Mizar and Acrux.
Examples include the white dwarf-pulsar binary PSR B1620-26, the subgiant-red dwarf binary Gamma Cephei, and the white dwarf-red dwarf binary NN Serpentis.
Binaries that are both visual and spectroscopic thus must be relatively close to Earth.
Second is by observing ellipsoidal light variations which are caused by deformation of the star's shape by their companions.
Examples of binaries are Sirius, and Cygnus X-1 (Cygnus X-1 being a well known black hole).
In this way, the relation between a star's appearance (temperature and radius) and its mass can be found, which allows for the determination of the mass of non-binaries.
Detection of position shifts of a star is a very exacting science, and it is difficult to achieve the necessary precision.
The name Algol means "demon star" (from  ''al-ghūl''), which was probably given due to its peculiar behavior.
In the case where the binary is also a spectroscopic binary and the parallax of the system is known, the binary is quite valuable for stellar analysis.
The position of the star is repeatedly measured relative to more distant stars, and then checked for periodic shifts in position.
Since the invention of the telescope, many pairs of double stars have been found.
In Cygnus X-1, the mass of the unseen companion is estimated to be about nine times that of the Sun, far exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit for the maximum theoretical mass of a neutron star.
Probably the best known example of an X-ray binary is the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1.
Systems with more than two stars are termed multiple stars.
Nearby stars often have a relatively high proper motion, so astrometric binaries will appear to follow a ''wobbly'' path across the sky.
Systems of two or more stars are called ''multiple star systems''.
It is also possible for widely separated binaries to lose gravitational contact with each other during their lifetime, as a result of external perturbations.
Cataclysmic variable stars, where the compact object is a white dwarf, are examples of such systems.
It is not uncommon that the accretion disc is the brightest (and thus sometimes the only visible) element of a binary star.
In cases where the binary star has a Bayer designation and is widely separated, it is possible that the members of the pair will be designated with superscripts; an example is Zeta Reticuli, whose components are ζ1 Reticuli and ζ2 Reticuli.
A study of fourteen previously known planetary systems found three of these systems to be binary systems.
However, the requirements to perform this measurement are very exacting, due to the great difference in the mass ratio, and the typically long period of the planet's orbit.
α Centauri, for example, was found to be double by Father Richaud in 1689, and so is designated ''RHD 1''.
Also in the Cygnus constellation is Cygnus X-1, an X-ray source considered to be a black hole.
Such stars are known as single-lined spectroscopic binaries ("SB1").
Another phenomenon observed in some Algol binaries has been monotonic period increases.
In some cases, these ''close binary systems'' can exchange mass, which may bring their evolution to stages that single stars cannot attain.
From precise astrometric measurements of the movement of the visible star over a sufficiently long period of time, information about the mass of the companion and its orbital period can be determined.
In these systems, the separation between the stars is usually very small, and the orbital velocity very high.
The white dwarf consists of degenerate matter, and so is largely unresponsive to heat, while the accreted hydrogen is not.
''Astrometric binaries'' are relatively nearby stars which can be seen to wobble around a point in space, with no visible companion.
Algol is the best-known example of an eclipsing binary.
Unless the plane of the orbit happens to be perpendicular to the line of sight, the orbital velocities will have components in the line of sight and the observed radial velocity of the system will vary periodically.
Science fiction has often featured planets of binary or ternary stars as a setting, for example George Lucas' Tatooine from ''Star Wars'', and one notable story, "Nightfall", even takes this to a six-star system.
More planets around binaries are listed in: .
Most of these cannot be resolved as a visual binary, even with telescopes of the highest existing resolving power.
A close encounter between two binary systems can also result in the gravitational disruption of both systems, with some of the stars being ejected at high velocities, leading to runaway stars.
A '''binary star''' is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter.
In 1915 astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory determined that Sirius B was a white dwarf, the first to be discovered.
From the orbital pattern of a visual binary, or the time variation of the spectrum of a spectroscopic binary, the mass of its stars can be determined, for example with the binary mass function.
Simulations have shown that the presence of a binary companion can actually improve the rate of planet formation within stable orbital zones by "stirring up" the protoplanetary disk, increasing the accretion rate of the protoplanets within.
The orbit of the stars in the binary pair is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10−5) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).
Typically this type of measurement can only be performed on nearby stars, such as those within 10 parsecs.
If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along our line of sight, its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called ''eclipsing binaries'', or, as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, ''photometric binaries''.
Nevertheless, their "doubleness" depends only on this optical effect; the stars themselves are distant from one another and share no physical connection.
In the last decade, measurement of extragalactic eclipsing binaries' fundamental parameters has become possible with 8 meter class telescopes.
Another visible ternary is Alpha Centauri, in the southern constellation of Centaurus, which contains the fourth brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of −0.01.
It is a high-mass X-ray binary, with the optical counterpart being a variable star.
If the orbit is elliptical, the shape of the curve will depend on the eccentricity of the ellipse and the orientation of the major axis with reference to the line of sight.
The outcome of the three-body problem, where the three stars are of comparable mass, is that eventually one of the three stars will be ejected from the system and, assuming no significant further perturbations, the remaining two will form a stable binary system.
If the motion is part of an orbit, or if the stars have similar radial velocities and the difference in their proper motions is small compared to their common proper motion, the pair is probably physical.
These binaries are classified as low-mass or high-mass according to the mass of the donor star.
The paradox can be solved by mass transfer: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its Roche lobe, and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence.
There is a direct correlation between the period of revolution of a binary star and the eccentricity of its orbit, with systems of short period having smaller eccentricity.
Other interesting binaries include 61 Cygni (a binary in the constellation Cygnus, composed of two K class (orange) main-sequence stars, 61 Cygni A and 61 Cygni B, which is known for its large proper motion), Procyon (the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor and the eighth brightest star in the night time sky, which is a binary consisting of the main star with a faint white dwarf companion), SS Lacertae (an eclipsing binary which stopped eclipsing), V907 Sco (an eclipsing binary which stopped, restarted, then stopped again) and BG Geminorum (an eclipsing binary which is thought to contain a black hole with a K0 star in orbit around it).
In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined Sirius B to be  in diameter, with a mass that is 98% of the Sun.
Alpha Centauri A and B have an 11&nbsp;AU distance at closest approach, and both should have stable habitable zones.
This is supporting evidence for the theory that binary systems are formed during star formation.
The large distance between the components, as well as their difference in color, make Albireo one of the easiest observable visual binaries.
Most binaries belong to this class.
In some publications (especially older ones), a faint secondary is called the ''comes'' (plural ''comites''; companion).
Hydrogen fusion can occur in a stable manner on the surface through the CNO cycle, causing the enormous amount of energy liberated by this process to blow the remaining gases away from the white dwarf's surface.
One of the tasks that remains for visual observers of double stars is to obtain sufficient observations to prove or disprove gravitational connection.
Since radial velocity can be measured with a spectrometer by observing the Doppler shift of the stars' spectral lines, the binaries detected in this manner are known as ''spectroscopic binaries''.
As a main-sequence star goes through an activity cycle, the outer layers of the star are subject to a magnetic torque changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in a change in the star's oblateness.
Recently, they have been used to give direct distance estimates to the LMC, SMC, Andromeda Galaxy and Triangulum Galaxy.
Even though the companion is not visible, the characteristics of the system can be determined from the observations using Kepler's laws.
Binary stars are classified into four types according to the way in which they are observed: visually, by observation; spectroscopically, by periodic changes in spectral lines; photometrically, by changes in brightness caused by an eclipse; or astrometrically, by measuring a deviation in a star's position caused by an unseen companion.
Apart from the Sun and stars which act as gravitational lenses, this can be done only in binary and multiple star systems, making the binary stars an important class of stars.
The companion could be very dim, so that it is currently undetectable or masked by the glare of its primary, or it could be an object that emits little or no electromagnetic radiation, for example a neutron star.
Orbital periods can be less than an hour (for AM CVn stars), or a few days (components of Beta Lyrae), but also hundreds of thousands of years (Proxima Centauri around Alpha Centauri AB).
In 1844 Friedrich Bessel deduced that Sirius was a binary.
Among gravitationally bound binary star systems, there exists a so-called log normal distribution of periods, with the majority of these systems orbiting with a period of about 100 years.
By 1803, he had observed changes in the relative positions in a number of double stars over the course of 25 years, and concluded that they must be binary systems; the first orbit of a binary star, however, was not computed until 1827, when Félix Savary computed the orbit of Xi Ursae Majoris.
This system also underscores the fact that binaries need not be discounted in the search for habitable planets.
This makes it feasible to use them to directly measure the distances to external galaxies, a process that is more accurate than using standard candles.
The components will then move on to evolve as single stars.
It is located in the constellation Canis Major.
Double stars are also designated by an abbreviation giving the discoverer together with an index number.
Optical doubles are so called because the two stars appear close together in the sky as seen from the Earth; they are almost on the same line of sight.
In other systems, the spectrum of only one of the stars is seen and the lines in the spectrum shift periodically towards the blue, then towards red and back again.
The uppermost part of the stellar atmospheres forms a ''common envelope'' that surrounds both stars.
The result is that matter will transfer from one star to another through a process known as Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), either being absorbed by direct impact or through an accretion disc.
From this projected ellipse the complete elements of the orbit may be computed, where the semi-major axis can only be expressed in angular units unless the stellar parallax, and hence the distance, of the system is known.
Another eclipsing binary is Beta Lyrae, which is a semi-detached binary star system in the constellation of Lyra.
Because this is a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.
Each of the components of Castor is itself a spectroscopic binary.
Space telescopes can avoid the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more precise resolution.
Also, the observation of binaries consisting of pre main-sequence stars, supports the theory that binaries are already formed during star formation.
Two components of the system eclipse each other, the variation in the intensity of Algol first being recorded in 1670 by Geminiano Montanari.
This ellipse is known as the ''apparent ellipse'', and is the projection of the actual elliptical orbit of the secondary with respect to the primary on the plane of the sky.
This method of detecting binaries is also used to locate extrasolar planets orbiting a star.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to obtain the complete orbit of a spectroscopic binary unless it is also a visual or an eclipsing binary, so from these objects only a determination of the joint product of mass and the sine of the angle of inclination relative to the line of sight is possible.
Since this time, many more double stars have been catalogued and measured.
the area where the gravitational pull of the star itself is larger than that of the other component.
In reality, some orbital ranges are impossible for dynamical reasons (the planet would be expelled from its orbit relatively quickly, being either ejected from the system altogether or transferred to a more inner or outer orbital range), whilst other orbits present serious challenges for eventual biospheres because of likely extreme variations in surface temperature during different parts of the orbit.
This discovery resulted in a recalculation of parameters for both the planet and the primary star.
An example of an eclipsing binary is Epsilon Aurigae in the constellation Auriga.
Astronomically, Castor was discovered to be a visual binary in 1719.
The Hubble Space Telescope recently took a picture of the remnants of this event.
The gravitational pull between them causes them to orbit around their common center of mass.
The latter are termed ''optical doubles'' or ''optical pairs''.
If the orbit is circular then the curve will be a sine curve.
The term ''double star'' is often used synonymously with ''binary star''; however, double star can also mean ''optical double star''.
Because a large proportion of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important to our understanding of the processes by which stars form.
The angular resolution of the telescope is an important factor in the detection of visual binaries, and as better angular resolutions are applied to binary star observations increasing number of visual binaries will be detected.
Additional letters, such as ''C'', ''D'', etc., may be used for systems with more than two stars.
Algol is the most noted ternary (long thought to be a binary), located in the constellation Perseus.
Binary stars are also common as the nuclei of many planetary nebulae, and are the progenitors of both novae and type Ia supernovae.
In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can actually be seen.
This also determines an empirical mass-luminosity relationship (MLR) from which the masses of single stars can be estimated.
The Applegate mechanism explains long term orbital period variations seen in certain eclipsing binaries.
In many cases, the inflowing gas forms an accretion disc around the accretor.
An ''eclipsing binary star'' is a binary star in which the orbit plane of the two stars lies so nearly in the line of sight of the observer that the components undergo mutual eclipses.
The light curve of an eclipsing binary is characterized by periods of practically constant light, with periodic drops in intensity.
After a sufficient number of observations are recorded over a period of time, they are plotted in polar coordinates with the primary star at the origin, and the most probable ellipse is drawn through these points such that the Keplerian law of areas is satisfied.
Gas from the surface of the Roche-lobe-filling component (donor) is transferred to the other, accreting star.
It is impossible to determine individually the semi-major axis ''a'' and the inclination of the orbit plane ''i''.
In the case of a visual binary star, after the orbit and the stellar parallax of the system has been determined, the combined mass of the two stars may be obtained by a direct application of the Keplerian harmonic law.
The visible component belongs to the spectral class F0, the other (eclipsing) component is not visible.
The visible star's position is carefully measured and detected to vary, due to the gravitational influence from its counterpart.
Mizar, in the  Big Dipper (Ursa Major), was observed to be double by Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1650 (and probably earlier by Benedetto Castelli and Galileo).
The Alcor–Mizar visual binary in Ursa Majoris also consists of six stars, four comprising Mizar and two comprising Alcor.
Conversely, spectroscopic binary stars move fast in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries.
The suffix ''AB'' may be used to denote the pair (for example, the binary star α Centauri AB consists of the stars α Centauri A and α Centauri B.)
If it is also a spectroscopic binary the orbital elements can also be determined, and the mass of the stars can be determined relatively easily, which means that the relative densities of the stars can be determined in this case.
The mathematical point through which this transfer happens is called the first Lagrangian point.
Most known double stars have not been studied sufficiently closely to determine whether they are optical doubles or they are doubles physically bound through gravitation into a multiple star system.
Detecting planets in multiple star systems introduces additional technical difficulties, which may be why they are only rarely found.
William Herschel began observing double stars in 1779 and soon thereafter published catalogs of about 700 double stars.
In X-ray binaries, the compact object can be either a neutron star or a black hole.
A ''visual binary'' star is a binary star for which the angular separation between the two components is great enough to permit them to be observed as a double star in a telescope, or even high-powered binoculars.
If one of the stars is larger than the other, one will be obscured by a total eclipse while the other will be obscured by an annular eclipse.
In systems where the brightnesses are different, the fainter star is bluer if the brighter star is a giant star, and redder if the brighter star belongs to the main sequence.
The position angle of the secondary with respect to the primary is measured, together with the angular distance between the two stars.
As the friction of the envelope brakes the orbital motion, the stars may eventually merge.
If the stars are the same brightness, the discoverer designation for the primary is customarily accepted.
In 1862 Alvan Graham Clark discovered the companion (Sirius B; the visible star is Sirius A).
If a white dwarf has a close companion star that overflows its Roche lobe, the white dwarf will steadily accrete gases from the star's outer atmosphere.
Any binary star can belong to several of these classes; for example, several spectroscopic binaries are also eclipsing binaries.
All planets were found to be in S-type orbits around the primary star.
These discoverer codes can be found in the Washington Double Star Catalog.
There are also examples of systems beyond ternaries: Castor is a sextuple star system, which is the second brightest star in the constellation Gemini and one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky.
The mass of a star can be directly determined only from its gravitational attraction.
Orbits are known for only a few thousand of these double stars,  and most have not been ascertained to be either true binaries or optical double stars.
A double star can be revealed as optical by means of differences in their parallax measurements, proper motions, or radial velocities.
Planets that orbit just one star in a binary system are said to have "S-type" orbits, whereas those that orbit around both stars have "P-type" or "circumbinary" orbits.
If a star grows outside of its Roche lobe too fast for all abundant matter to be transferred to the other component, it is also possible that matter will leave the system through other Lagrange points or as stellar wind, thus being effectively lost to both components.
The relative brightness of the two stars is also an important factor, as glare from a bright star may make it difficult to detect the presence of a fainter component.
If either ''a'' or ''i'' can be determined by other means, as in the case of eclipsing binaries, a complete solution for the orbit can be found.
Binary stars may be found with any conceivable separation, from pairs orbiting so closely that they are practically in contact with each other, to pairs so distantly separated that their connection is indicated only by their common proper motion through space.
The period of the orbit of an eclipsing binary may be determined from a study of the light curve, and the relative sizes of the individual stars can be determined in terms of the radius of the orbit by observing how quickly the brightness changes as the disc of the near star slides over the disc of the distant star.
First is by observing extra light which the stars reflect from their companion.
Monotonic period increases have been attributed to mass transfer, usually (but not always) from the less massive to the more massive star
Binary stars are often detected optically, in which case they are called ''visual binaries''.
When a binary system contains a compact object such as a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole, gas from the other (donor) star can accrete onto the compact object.
''a'' sin ''i'') may be determined directly in linear units (e.g.
Astronomers have discovered some stars that seemingly orbit around an empty space.
This releases gravitational potential energy, causing the gas to become hotter and emit radiation.
A ''contact binary'' is a type of binary star in which both components of the binary fill their Roche lobes.
Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known.
The components of binary stars are denoted by the suffixes ''A'' and ''B'' appended to the system's designation, ''A'' denoting the primary and ''B'' the secondary.
If ''a'' is taken to be the semi-major axis of the orbit of one body around the other, then ''r''1 will be the semimajor axis of the first body's orbit around the center of mass or ''barycenter'', and ''r''2 = ''a'' – ''r''1 will be the semimajor axis of the second body's orbit.
Castor also has a faint and widely separated companion, which is also a spectroscopic binary.
Eclipsing binaries are variable stars, not because the light of the individual components vary but because of the eclipses.
It is estimated that 50–60% of binary systems are capable of supporting habitable terrestrial planets within stable orbital ranges.
Close non-eclipsing binaries can also be photometrically detected by observing how the stars affect each other in three ways.
Double stars may be binary systems or may be merely two stars that appear to be close together in the sky but have vastly different true distances from the Sun.
The result is an extremely bright outburst of light, known as a nova.
Binary star systems are very important in astrophysics because calculations of their orbits allow the masses of their component stars to be directly determined, which in turn allows other stellar parameters, such as radius and density, to be indirectly estimated.
In these three cases the secondary star was much dimmer than the primary and so was not previously detected.
In the case of eclipsing binaries which are also spectroscopic binaries, it is possible to find a complete solution for the specifications (mass, density, size, luminosity, and approximate shape) of both members of the system.
The observations are plotted against time, and from the resulting curve a period is determined.
Sirius is another binary and the brightest star in the night time sky, with a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46.
Binaries provide the best method for astronomers to determine the mass of a distant star.
Fragmentation of the molecular cloud during the formation of protostars is an acceptable explanation for the formation of a binary or multiple star system.
These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means.
The orbit of a spectroscopic binary is determined by making a long series of observations of the radial velocity of one or both components of the system.
Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.
If the companion is sufficiently massive to cause an observable shift in position of the star, then its presence can be deduced.
