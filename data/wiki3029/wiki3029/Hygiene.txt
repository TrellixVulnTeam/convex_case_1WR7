The main "highways" for spread of germs in the home are the hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths and utensils.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing with ash if soap is not available in emergencies, schools without access to soap  and other difficult situations like post-emergencies where use of (clean) sand is recommended too.
Bathing was replaced by the heavy use of sweat-bathing and perfume, as it was thought in Europe that water could carry disease into the body through the skin.
As a rule of thumb, powders and tablets normally contain an activated oxygen bleach, but liquids, and all products (liquid or powder) used for "coloureds" do not.
In general, the Qur'an advises Muslims to uphold high standards of physical hygiene and to be ritually clean whenever possible.
According to medieval historian Lynn Thorndike, people in Medieval Europe probably bathed more than people did in the 19th century.
Chemical disinfectants are products that kill germs (harmful bacteria, viruses and fungi).
A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses etc.
People tend to develop a routine for attending to their personal hygiene needs.
the reduction in contamination on fabrics) obtained, in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence, based on currently available data.
The Romans used scented oils (mostly from Egypt), among other alternatives.
Strachan further proposed that the reason why this exposure no longer occurs is, not only because of the trend towards smaller families, but also "improved household amenities and higher standards of personal cleanliness".
Personal grooming extends personal hygiene as it pertains to the maintenance of a good personal and public appearance, which need not necessarily be hygienic.
In 14th century Tuscany, the newlywed couple's bath together was such a firm convention one such couple, in a large coopered tub, is illustrated in fresco in the town hall of San Gimignano.

A number of other factors can also contribute including drying and ironing.
An antibacterial is not necessarily anti-fungal or anti-viral unless this is stated on the label.
Targeted hygiene is based on identifying the  routes of spread of pathogens in the home, and applying hygiene procedures at critical points at appropriate times to break the chain of infection.
Increasingly, all of these "at-risk" groups are cared for at home by a carer who may be a household member who thus requires a good knowledge of hygiene.
are a risk factor for infection transmission in home and everyday life settings as well as institutional settings, although the lack of quantitative data directly linking contaminated clothing to infection in the domestic setting makes it difficult to assess the extent of the risk.
Alcohol hand sanitizers however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands.
To be effective as a hygiene measure, this process must be followed by thorough rinsing under running water to remove germs from the surface.
NDM-1 or ESBL-producing strains).
He used to take baths, he had his head very closely shaved, he polished his skin, he cleaned his nail, he had his hair cut as short as if it were turned on a lathe, and he wore linen underclothes and a snow-white shirt.''
(A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.)
laundering of clothing and household linens such as towels and bedlinen.
Day-to-day hygiene practices, other than special medical hygiene procedures are no different for those at increased risk of infection than for other family members.
Excessive body hygiene is one example of obsessive compulsive disorder.
Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of earwax can actually reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.
Most of these practices were developed in the 19th century and were well established by the mid-20th century.
Germ kill is achieved using a "micro-biocidal" product i.e.
Air-borne fungi are usually associated with damp conditions, poor ventilation or closed air systems.
Cleaning action arises primarily from the action of the surfactants and other ingredients, which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid, together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains.
If a shower has not been used for some time, it should be left to run at a hot temperature for a few minutes before use.
Research shows that, if widely practiced, hand washing with soap could reduce diarrhea by almost fifty percent and respiratory infections by nearly twenty-five percent  Hand washing with soap also reduces the incidence of skin diseases, eye infections like trachoma and intestinal worms, especially ascariasis and trichuriasis.
''Hygiene'' is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion and preservation of health, also called hygienic.
About 2 million people die every year due to diarrheal diseases, most of them are children less than 5 years of age.
As a result, there is significant variability in the recommendations for hygienic laundering of clothing etc.
During the wash cycle soil and microbes are detached from fabrics and suspended into the wash water.
Some practices are gender-specific, such as by a woman during her menstrual cycle.
If the product is a disinfectant, the label on the product should say "disinfectant" and/or "kills" germs or bacteria etc.
At a later date Roman Catholic Church officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt syphilis epidemics from sweeping Europe.
Antiseptics may be applied to cuts, wounds abrasions of the skin to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis.
Routine cleaning of  (hand, food, and drinking water) sites and surfaces (such as toilet seats and flush handles, door and tap handles, work surfaces, bath and basin surfaces) in the kitchen, bathroom and toilet reduces the risk of spread of germs.
The hygiene hypothesis was first formulated in 1989 by Strachan who observed that there was an inverse relationship between family size and development of atopic allergic disorders – the more children in a family, the less likely they were to develop these allergies.
Chemical inactivation of microbes by the surfactants and activated oxygen-based bleach used in detergents also contributes to the hygiene effectiveness of laundering.
Soapmaking first became an established trade during the so-called "Dark Ages".
Infection risks from contaminated clothing etc.
that have led to decreased exposure to certain microbial or other species, such as helminths, that are important for development of immuno-regulatory mechanisms.
The main sources of infection in the home are people (who are carriers or are infected), foods (particularly raw foods) and water, and domestic animals (in the U.S. more than 50% of homes have one or more pets).
The drive for cleanliness persisted, however, particularly cleanliness in children.
Secular medieval texts constantly refer to the washing of hands before and after meals, but Sone de Nansay, hero of a 13th-century romance, discovers to his chagrin that the Norwegians do not wash up after eating.
Other uses of the term appear in phrases including: ''body hygiene, personal hygiene, sleep hygiene, mental hygiene, dental hygiene,'' and ''occupational hygiene'', used in connection with public health.
Bathing encouraged an erotic atmosphere that was played upon by the writers of romances intended for the upper class; in the tale of Melusine the bath was a crucial element of the plot.
If this is the case, there is no conflict between the goals of preventing infection and minimising allergies.
# Multibarrier methods – Some systems use two or more of the above treatments in combination or in succession to optimize efficacy.
First attested in English in 1677s, the word ''hygiene'' comes from the French ''hygiene'', the latinisation of  the Greek ὑγιεινή (τέχνη) ''hugieinē technē'', meaning "(art) of health", from ὑγιεινός ''hugieinos'', "good for the health, healthy", in turn from ὑγιής (''hugiēs''), "healthful, sound, salutary, wholesome".
Hygiene practices vary widely, and what is considered acceptable in one culture might not be acceptable in another.
Social acceptance is an important part of encouraging people to use toilets and wash their hands.
In 2013 the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene (IFH) reviewed some 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at various temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70&nbsp;°C, under varying conditions.
Some also kill fungi (fungicidal), bacterial spores (sporicidal) and/or viruses (virucidal).
In the developing world, for decades, universal access to water and sanitation has been seen as the essential step in reducing the preventable ID burden, but it is now clear that this is best achieved by programs that integrate hygiene promotion with improvements in water quality and availability, and sanitation.
It may involve, for example, using deodorants or perfume, shaving, or combing, besides other practices.
In some cultures removal of body hair is considered proper hygiene.
Experience in the USA suggests that these strains are transmissible within families, but also in community settings such as prisons, schools and sport teams.
Skin-to-skin contact (including unabraded skin) and indirect contact with contaminated objects such as towels, sheets and sports equipment seem to represent the mode of transmission.
# Chemical disinfection using chlorine or iodine
Medical hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease in relation to administering medical care to those who are infected or who are more "at risk" of infection in the home.
Roman cities also had large sewers, such as Rome's Cloaca Maxima, into which public and private latrines drained.
In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms.
Safe disposal of human waste is a fundamental need; poor sanitation is a primary cause of diarrhea disease in low income communities.
Though it took decades for his findings to gain wide acceptance, governments and sanitary reformers were eventually convinced of the health benefits of using sewers to keep human waste from contaminating water.
In low-income communities, mud or ash is sometimes used as an alternative to soap.
* Mechanical removal (i.e.
An antibacterial product is a product that acts against bacteria in some unspecified way.
Drinking water quality remains a significant problem, not only in developing countries but also in developed countries; even in the European region it is estimated that 120 million people do not have access to safe drinking water.
Thorough cleaning is important in preventing the spread of fungal infections.
Thus, when circumstances combine, people become exposed, either directly or via food or water, and can develop an infection.
Germs can also spread via clothing and household linens, such as towels.
Hand sanitizers are not an option in most developing countries.
Some cultures do not kiss or shake hands to reduce transmission of bacteria by contact.
Other personal hygienic practices would include covering one's mouth when coughing, disposal of soiled tissues appropriately, making sure toilets are clean, and making sure food handling areas are clean, besides other practices.
Excessive body hygiene of the ear canals can result in infection or irritation.
Hygienic cleaning can be done by:
to eliminate germs before they can spread further.
Contrary to popular belief and although the Early Christian leaders, such as Boniface I, condemned bathing as unspiritual, bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire.
Household water treatment and safe storage ensure drinking water is safe for consumption.
It also includes the very young, patients discharged from hospital, taking immuno-suppressive drugs or using invasive systems, etc.
The most affected are the populations in developing countries, living in extreme conditions of poverty, normally peri-urban dwellers or rural inhabitants.
The difference is that, if hygiene practices are not correctly carried out, the risk of infection is much greater.
Water was constantly changed by an aqueduct-fed flow.
Other than the need to be ritually clean in time for the daily prayer (Arabic: ''Salat'') through Wuzu and Ghusl, there are a large number of other hygiene-related rules governing the lives of Muslims.
In particular the data indicates that clothing and household linens are a risk factor for spread of S. aureus (including MRSA and PVL-producing MRSA strains), and that effectiveness of laundry processes may be an important factor in defining the rate of community spread of these strains.
Although activated oxygen bleach is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains, it also produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known.
In situations with limited water supply, there are water-conserving solutions, such as tippy-taps.
The infection risk from the toilet itself is not high, provided it is properly maintained, although some splashing and aerosol formation can occur during flushing, particularly where someone in the family has diarrhea.
Hygiene measures, including laundry hygiene, are an important part of reducing spread of antibiotic resistant strains.
More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the hands (alcohol hand sanitizers).
Water left stagnant in the pipes of showers can be contaminated with germs that become airborne when the shower is turned on.
There is still much uncertainty as to which lifestyle factors are involved.
Medieval church authorities believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease; the 26 public baths of Paris in the late 13th century were strictly overseen by the civil authorities.
The ear canals require less body hygiene care than other parts of the body, because they are sensitive, and the body system adequately cares for these parts.
In the home, this routine should be carried out as part of a multibarrier approach to hygiene which also includes hand, food, respiratory and other hygiene practices.
can increase significantly under certain conditions.
* Using a process or product that inactivates the pathogens in situ.
This has caused concern among health professionals that everyday life hygiene behaviours, which are the foundation of public health, are being undermined.
# Use safe water and raw materials
catheter or dressing replacement, which puts them at higher risk of infection.
Whilst targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice, it also seeks, as far as possible, to sustain "normal" levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system.
Because the "infectious dose" for some pathogens can be very small (10-100 viable units, or even less for some viruses), and infection can result from direct transfer from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth, nasal mucosa or the eye, 'hygienic cleaning' procedures should be sufficient to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces.
Whereas in popular culture and parlance it can often mean mere 'cleanliness', hygiene in its fullest and original meaning goes much beyond that to include all circumstances and practices, lifestyle issues, premises and commodities that engender a safe and healthy environment.
Mold can be responsible for infections, cause allergic responses, deteriorate/damage surfaces and cause unpleasant odors.
This showed many benefits such as reduced child mortality rates.
In the community, otherwise healthy people can become persistent skin carriers of MRSA, or faecal carriers of enterobacteria strains which can carry multi-antibiotic resistance factors (e.g.
A consensus is now developing among experts that the answer lies in more fundamental changes in lifestyle etc.
It includes antiseptics and disinfectants, which combat micro-organisms, and also includes pesticides.

These are then "washed away" during the rinse and spin cycles.
Since the 7th century, Islam has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene.
Modern sanitation was not widely adopted until the 19th and 20th centuries.
by contact with contaminated hands or using dirty storage vessels), safe storage of water in the home is also important.
Although microbiological data indicates that risks from clothing and household linens are somewhat less than those associated with hands, hand contact and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths, nevertheless these risks needs to be appropriately managed through effective laundering practices.
The term sanitizer has been used to define substances that both clean and disinfect.
Adding hypochlorite bleach in the washing process also achieves inactivation of microbes.
Not all disinfectants kill all types of germs.
Since cleaning processes (e.g., hand washing) remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil, they are often the means to achieve hygiene.
Although there is substantial evidence that some microbial exposures in early childhood can in some way protect against allergies, there is no evidence that we need exposure to harmful microbes (infection) or that we need to suffer a clinical infection.
Until the late 19th Century, only the elite in Western cities typically possessed indoor facilities for relieving bodily functions.
While in modern medical sciences there is a set of standards of hygiene recommended for different situations, what is considered hygienic or not can vary between different cultures, genders and etarian groups.
This encouraged the widespread adoption of both the flush toilet and the moral imperative that bathrooms should be indoors and as private as possible.
in healthcare situations in hospitals, care homes and the domestic setting where someone has diarrhoea, vomiting, or a skin or wound infection.
Other practices that are generally considered proper hygiene include bathing regularly, washing hands regularly and especially before handling food, washing scalp hair, keeping hair short or removing hair, wearing clean clothing, brushing one's teeth, cutting finger nails, besides other practices.
Since water can become contaminated during storage at home (e.g.
Of concern is recent data suggesting that, in reality, modern domestic washing machines do not reach the temperature specified on the machine controls.
Other issues include the Islamic dietary laws.
In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a "risk-based" or targeted approach to home hygiene that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focussed on the places, and at the times most critical for infection transmission.
Germs can survive in the scum or scale left behind on baths and wash basins after washing and bathing.
Across the world, governments are increasingly under pressure to fund the level of healthcare that people expect.
This changed after Dr. John Snow discovered that cholera was transmitted by the fecal contamination of water.
It is, therefore, important to check whether the product label states that it "kills" bacteria."
when in a public place with no access to wash facilities), a waterless hand sanitizer such as an alcohol hand gel can be used.
Some commercial products, e.g.
Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear.
Items most likely to be contaminated with pathogens are those that come into direct contact with the body, e.g., underwear, personal towels, facecloths, nappies.
In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a risk-based approach  based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which has come to be known as "targeted hygiene".
For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.
Some procedures (such as disposal of medical waste) were refined in response to late-20th century disease outbreaks, notably AIDS and Ebola.
a disinfectant or antibacterial product or waterless hand sanitizer, or by application of heat.
They can also be used in addition to hand washing, to minimize risks when caring for "at risk" groups.
# Filtration using ceramic filters
Laundry hygiene pertains to the practices that prevent or minimize disease and the spreading of disease via soiled clothing and household linens such as towels.
Some products labelled "antibacterial" kill bacteria while others may contain a concentration of active ingredient that only prevent them multiplying.
From this, he hypothesised that lack of exposure to "infections" in early childhood transmitted by contact with older siblings could be a cause of the rapid rise in atopic disorders over the last thirty to forty years.
Elaborate baths were constructed in urban areas to serve the public, who typically demanded the infrastructure to maintain personal cleanliness.
are constantly shed from these sources via mucous membranes, faeces, vomit, skin scales, etc.
Northern Europeans were not in the habit of bathing: in the ninth century Notker the Stammerer, a Frankish monk of St Gall, related a disapproving  anecdote that attributed ill results of personal hygiene to an Italian fashion:
Cloths or other fabric items used during food preparation, or for cleaning  the toilet or cleaning up material such as faeces or vomit are a particular risk.
Respiratory viruses and fungal spores are also spread via the air.
Cleaning of toilets and hand wash facilities is important to prevent odors and make them socially acceptable.
Bathing was said to be a prelude to sin, and in the penitential of Burchard of Worms we find a full catalogue of the sins that ensued when men and women bathed together."
cleaning) using a soap or detergent.
Some regular hygienic practices may be considered good habits by a society while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful or even threatening.
Although media coverage of the hygiene hypothesis has declined, a strong ‘collective mindset’ has become established that dirt is ‘healthy’ and hygiene somehow ‘unnatural’.
given by different agencies.
People with reduced immunity to infection, who are looked after at home, make up an increasing proportion of the population (currently up to 20%).
For patients discharged from hospital, or being treated at home special "medical hygiene" (see above) procedures may need to be performed for them e.g.
The risks are not apparent until, for example, they are admitted to hospital, when they can become "self infected" with their own resistant organisms following a surgical procedure.
* In some cases combined germ removal with kill is used, e.g.
Preventing the spread of infectious diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission.
It was also based in part on eugenics, and by the 1930s thousands of forced sterilizations of people deemed undesirable took place in America each year.
In the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other products, good hygiene is a key part of quality assurance i.e.

# Combined flocculation/disinfection systems – available as sachets of powder that act by coagulating and flocculating sediments in water followed by release of chlorine.
Some time after Louis Pasteur's experiments proved the germ theory of disease and Joseph Lister and others put them into practice in sanitation, hygienic practices came to be regarded as synonymous with health, as they are in modern times.
In the 11th and 12th centuries, bathing was essential to the Western European upper class: the Cluniac monasteries to which they resorted or retired were always provided with bathhouses, and even the monks were required to take full immersion baths twice a year, at the two Christian festivals of renewal, though exhorted not to uncover themselves from under their bathing sheets.
Molds can live on wall and floor tiles and on shower curtains.
To be effective, alcohol hand gels should contain not less than 60%v/v alcohol.
Other hygiene practices, such as safe disposal of waste, surface hygiene, and care of domestic animals, are also important in low income communities to break the chain of infection transmission.
Good home hygiene means targeting hygiene procedures at critical points, at appropriate times, to break the chain of infection i.e.
In medicine and in home (domestic) and everyday life settings, hygiene practices are employed as preventative measures to reduce the incidence and spreading of disease.
Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out.
All disinfectants kill bacteria (called bactericidal).
During laundering, temperature, together with the action of water and detergent work together to reduce microbial contamination levels on fabrics.
Use of ash is common and has in experiments been shown at least as effective as soap for removing bacteria.
Care of increasing numbers of patients in the community, including at home is one answer, but can be fatally undermined by inadequate infection control in the home.
In situations where hand washing with soap is not an option (e.g.
Microbiological and epidemiological data indicates that clothing and household linens etc.
Excessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can also adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin.
# UV irradiation - community or household UV systems may be batch or flow-though.
Additionally, sites that accumulate stagnant water&mdash;such as sinks, toilets, waste pipes, cleaning tools, face cloths&mdash;readily support microbial growth, and can become secondary reservoirs of infection, though species are mostly those that threaten "at risk" groups.
The term biocide is a broad term for a substance that kills, inactivates or otherwise controls living organisms.
Point-of-use water quality interventions can reduce diarrheal disease in communities where water quality is poor, or in emergency situations where there is a breakdown in water supply.
Bathing outside of urban centers involved smaller, less elaborate bathing facilities, or simply the use of clean bodies of water.
The simple principle is that, if the chain of infection is broken, infection cannot spread.
Regular bathing was a hallmark of Roman civilization.
Germs (potentially infectious bacteria, viruses etc.)
