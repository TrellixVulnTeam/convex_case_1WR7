* '''Electromagnetically:''' the ''signal'' inside the phone's speaker is picked up by the hearing aid's "telecoil" or "T-coil", a special loop of wire inside the hearing aid.
One approach is audiometry which measures a subject's hearing levels in laboratory conditions.
If the desired speech arrives from the direction of steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio.
Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.
Behind the ear aids (BTE) consist of a case, an earmold or dome and a connection between them.
The hearing professional determines the gain and other specifications required for the wearer, and then adjusts the analog components either with small controls on the hearing aid itself or by having a laboratory build the hearing aid to meet those specifications.
There are still some specialized situations where hearing aids built into the frame of eyeglasses can be useful, such as when a person has hearing loss mainly in one ear: sound from a microphone on the "bad" side can be sent through the frame to the side with better hearing.
Cross systems are used for people with hearing loss in one ear or significantly more in one ear, this system allows the user to wear technically a microphone in one ear and the speech is transferred into a speaker in the good ear, whilst the cone in the good ear allow normal hearing
The first electrical hearing aid used the carbon microphone of the telephone and was introduced in 1896.
In the canal (ITC) aids are smaller, filling only the bottom half of the external ear.
By the late 20th century, digital hearing aids were commercially available.
The FCC has set a timetable for the development and sale of digital wireless telephones that are compatible with hearing aids.
Major VA medical facilities provide complete diagnostic and audiology services.
Under Central and state government health services, the poor can often avail themselves of free hearing devices.
Body aids are still marketed in emerging markets because of their lower cost.
"Open-fit" or "over-the-ear" (OTE) hearing aids are small behind-the-ear type devices.
BTE hearing aids range from ISK 60,000 to ISK 300,000.
When removing your glasses for cleaning, the hearing aids are detached at the same time.
Secure telephones, as well as telephones used with public mobile and private radio services, are exempt from the HAC Act.

The electromagnetic (telecoil) mode is usually more effective than the acoustic method.
When the child's skull bone is sufficiently thick, a titanium "post" can be surgically embedded into the skull with a small abutment exposed outside the skin.
In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, up to $500 for each hearing aid.
Note that telecoil coupling has nothing to do with the radio signal in a cellular or cordless phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the voice coil in the phone's speaker as it pushes the speaker cone back and forth.
IIC types are most suitable for users up to middle age, but are not suitable for more elderly people.

The electronic circuitry varies among devices, even if they are the same style.
The Veterans Administration pays the full cost of testing and hearing aids to qualified military Veterans.
There are two ways telephones and hearing aids can connect with each other:
Modern hearing aid button cell types are typically referred to by their common number name or the color of their packaging.
FM systems have been found to provide a better signal to noise ratio even at larger speaker-to-talker distances in simulated testing conditions.
The threshold of audibility for various sounds and intensities is measured in a variety of conditions.
These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs soft, speech vs music, quiet vs noisy, etc.
BTE Bi Cross System is the same as the Cross system, however it can also enhance the hearing in the individuals better ear by enhancing the volume of the input, therefore channeling the sound into the good ear, whilst enhancing the clarity and volume for it also
Some of the advantages with this approach include improved sound quality, reduced case size, “open-fit” technology, and immediate patient fitting.
Though if an adult has a hearing loss which substantially limits major life activities, some state-run vocational rehabilitation programs can provide upwards of full financial assistance.
Only very recently has the technology required become small enough to be fitted in the frame of the glasses.
External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises.
The hearing professional programs the hearing aid with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis.
Unlike other hearing aid types, with the IIC aid the majority of the ear is not blocked (occluded) by a large plastic shell.
Whilst there are genuine instances where spectacle aids are a preferred choice, they may not always be the most practical option.
Every electronic hearing aid has at minimum a microphone, a loudspeaker (commonly called a receiver), a battery, and electronic circuitry.
Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for ''conductive hearing losses'' or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.
Earmolds are made from a variety of hard (firm) and soft (pliable) materials.
Another disadvantage is that some noises often contain characteristics similar to speech, making it difficult for the hearing aid processor to distinguish the speech from the noise.
The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc.
Batteries are free.
This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices.
Audio induction  loops, telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.
Many theatres and lecture halls are now equipped with assistive listening systems that transmit the sound directly from the stage; audience members can borrow suitable receivers and hear the program without background noise.
They are made of soft material designed to contour to each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss.
The hearing aid is built into the speaker of the stethoscope, which amplifies the sound.
Several industrialized countries supply free or heavily discounted hearing aids through their publicly funded health care system.
This is because it fits deeper in the canal than other types, so that it is out of view even when looking directly into the ear bowl (concha).
Military Veterans receiving VA medical care are eligible for hearing aids based on medical need.
;"Mini" BTE (or "on-the-ear") aids
Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g.
These devices are worn for 1–3 months at a time without removal.
Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively.
These aids are designed to use power sparingly, so that the battery lasts longer than batteries used in traditional hearing aids.
However, the rules are complicated and require that both ears have a significant hearing loss in order to qualify for reimbursement.
This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems.
Some modern circuits are able to provide feedback regulation or cancellation to assist with this.
A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services.
While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device.
ITE hearing aids are custom made to fit each individual's ear.
In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places.
Other than BAHAs (Bone anchored hearing aid), where specifically required, BTEs are usually the only style available.
A very thin, almost invisible tube is used to connect the aid to the ear canal.
Although T-coils are effectively a wide-band receiver, interference is unusual in most hearing loop situations.
Depending on their size, some models allow the wearer to use a mobile phone as a remote control to alter memory and volume settings, instead of taking the IIC out to do this.
Because the device’s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models.
In fitting, an audiologist takes a physical impression (mold) of the ear.
2.4 gigahertz Bluetooth connectivity is the most recent innovation in wireless interfacing for hearing instruments to audio sources such as TV streamers or Bluetooth enabled mobile phones.
BTEs can be used for mild to profound hearing loss.
The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer.
5.8&nbsp;mm × 2.1&nbsp;mm
This technology can be applied to ready-to-wear devices (BTE, Mini BTE, RIE, etc.)
Devices rated below M3 are unsatisfactory for people with hearing aids.
Private purchases may be necessary if a user desires a different style.
Recent hearing aids include wireless hearing aids.
Unlike the bone conduction spectacles the sound is transmitted via hearing aids which are attached to the arm or arms of the spectacles.
A new type of BTE aid called the mini BTE (or "on-the-ear") aid.
The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the nerve fibers of the inner ear, allowing hearing.
They can be used with telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and induction loop systems (also called "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs.
It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used.
This patent formed the basis of all subsequent fully digital hearing aids from all manufacturers, including those produced currently.
The states of Florida and Arizona have passed legislation that requires hearing professionals to inform patients about the usefulness of telecoils.
The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around.
This design is intended to reduce the occlusion effect.
In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common.
However, there are new ITEs made from a silicone type material that mitigates the need for costly replacements.
This is because the wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional microphone in a given situation.
"Secure" phones are defined as "telephones that are approved by the U.S. Government for the transmission of classified or sensitive voice communications."
+'''Hearing Aid Battery Types'''
These might include workplace telephones, telephones in confined settings (like hospitals and nursing homes), and telephones in hotel and motel rooms.
Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids.
More and more adults discover the benefits of wireless FM systems as well, especially since transmitters with different microphone settings and Bluetooth for wireless cell phone communication have become available.
Current hearing aids generally do not stream directly via Bluetooth but rather do so through a secondary streaming device (usually worn around the neck or in a pocket), this bluetooth enabled secondary device then streams wirelessly to the hearing aid but can only do so over a short distance.
Most private healthcare providers in the United States do not provide coverage for hearing aids, so all costs are usually borne by the recipient.
Finally, the aid is assembled and shipped to the audiologist after a quality check.
These are generally worn by people with a hearing loss who either prefer a more cosmetic appeal of their hearing aids by being attached to their glasses or where sound cannot be passed in the normal way, via a hearing aids, perhaps due to a blockage in the ear canal.
Real ear measurements (or probe microphone measurements) are an assessment of the characteristics of hearing aid amplification near the ear drum using a silicone probe tube microphone.
The direction of amplification or rejection is varied by the hearing aid processor.
These 'hearing glasses' incorporate a directional microphone capability: four microphones on each side of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user.
Disposable hearing aids are meant to remove the task of battery replacement and other maintenance chores (adjustment or cleanings).
This means that sounds originating from the direction the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions.
Patients may experience numbness of the area around the implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure.
IEC: PR70, ANSI: 7005ZD
;Directional spectacles
This can be worn from the age of one month as babies tend to tolerate this arrangement very well.
فوناك.jpg|Phonak wireless FM system
The amount of benefit a hearing aid delivers depends in large part on the quality of its fitting.
The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion.
With this testing, digital cordless phone manufacturers will be able to inform consumers about which products will work with their hearing aids.
As the electrical components are located outside the ear, the chance of moisture and earwax damaging the components is reduced, which can increase the durability of the instrument.
This type of circuitry is generally more flexible than simple adjustable controls.
A 1976 statute explicitly prohibits any state requirement that is "different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable" to regulated medical devices (which includes hearing aids) which relates "to the safety and effectiveness of the device."
Traditionally, ITEs have not been recommended for young children because their fit could not be as easily modified as the earmold for a BTE, and thus the aid had to be replaced frequently as the child grew.
Unless the user manually temporarily switches to a "restaurant program, forward only mode" adaptive directional microphones frequently amplify the speech of other talkers in a cocktail party type environments, such as restaurants or coffee shops.
Another method is to use a "neckloop" (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.).
5.8&nbsp;mm × 3.6&nbsp;mm
Mini BTEs may have a comfortable ear piece for insertion ("open fit"), but may also use a traditional earmold.
(Older hearing aids often used mercury battery cells, but these cells have become banned in most countries today.)
Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan.
Inside the ear canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.
Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.
These hearing aids are designed for medical practitioners with hearing loss who use stethoscopes.
It also fits behind/on the ear, but is smaller.
While the design approach is attractive to a general hearing aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's).
temple pieces of the spectacles.
For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported.
Action on Hearing Loss mobilised a campaign against the proposal.
Sounds are transmitted via a receiver attached from the arm of the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull at the back of the ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on the arm of the spectacles.
Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a “streamer”, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices.
The first practical electronic hearing aid with adjustable analog audio circuitry was based on US Patent 2,017,358, "Hearing Aid Apparatus and Amplifier" by Samual Gordon Taylor, filed in 1932.
On March 21, 2007, the Telecommunications Industry Association issued the  TIA-1083 standard, which gives manufacturers of cordless telephones the ability to test their products for compatibility with most hearing aids that have a T-Coil magnetic coupling mode.
There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery.
Devices similar to hearing aids include the bone anchored hearing aid, and cochlear implant.
Less expensive hearing aids can be found on the internet or mail order catalogs, but most in the under-$200 range tend to amplify the low frequencies of background noise, making it harder to hear the human voice.
In-the-ear hearing aids are typically more expensive than behind-the-ear counterparts of equal functionality, because they are custom fitted to the patient's ear.
Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes.
** Adjustable control: The audio circuit is analog with electronic components that can be adjusted.
Invisible in canal hearing aids (IIC) style of hearing aids fits inside the ear canal completely, leaving little to no trace of an installed hearing aid visible.
More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field.
Mini in canal (MIC) or completely in canal (CIC) aids are generally not visible unless the viewer looks directly into the wearer's ear.
A BAHA can be connected to an FM system by attaching a miniaturized FM receiver to it.
They can be used in mild to some severe hearing losses.
In 2014 the Clinical Commissioning Group in North Staffordshire considered proposals to end provision of free hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate age related hearing loss, which currently cost them £1.2m a year.

This can also be achieved by using CROS or bi-CROS style hearing aids, which are now wireless in sending sound to the better side.
Many hearing aids now have both an omnidirectional and a directional microphone mode.
While there are some rare instances that a hearing aid uses a rechargeable battery or a long-life disposable battery, the majority of modern hearing aids use one of five standard button cell zinc–air batteries.
With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone.
The digitally modeled ''shell'' is printed using a rapid prototyping technique such as stereolithography.
IEC: PR41, ANSI: 7002ZD
Spectacle aids come in two forms, ''bone conduction spectacles'' and ''air conduction spectacles''.
* When operating in electromagnetic ('''T'''elecoil) mode, the ratings are from T1 (worst) to T4 (best).
Although audiometric tests may attempt to mimic real-world conditions, the patient's own every day experiences may differ.
Hearing aid providers in Ireland mostly belong to the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists.
The presence of multiple speech signals makes it difficult for the processor to correctly select the desired speech signal.
From 2000 to 2005 the Department of Health worked with Action on Hearing Loss (then called RNID) to improve the quality of NHS hearing aids so every NHS audiology department in England was fitting digital hearing aids by March 2005.
# aided speech recognition
living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g.
The term "compatibility" is applied to all three types of telephones (wired, cordless, and mobile).
High-Power BTEs, Cochlear Implants
Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, can be used in all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids.
The case contains the electronic amplifier components, controls and battery while the earmold typically contains a miniature loudspeaker.
Despite the disadvantages, adaptive directional microphones can provide improved speech recognition in noise
Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the ear canal.
The case is typically about the size of a pack of playing cards and is carried in a pocket or on a belt.
Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used.
Typical battery lifetimes run between 1 and 14 days (assuming 16-hour days).
The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka.
Such sound processing can be considerable, such as highlighting a spatial region, shifting frequencies, cancelling noise and wind, or highlighting voice.
Available in all hearing aid styles, these hearing aids differ from traditional hearing aids only in that they are adjustable by the consumer.
The aid cannot be seen when face to face with the wearer.
Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise.
Individuals under the age of two (five in the USA) typically wear the BAHA device on a Softband.
# hearing aid usage
By 2003 Over 175,000 NHS digital hearing aids had been fitted to 125,000 people.
Conversely, because of the increased possibility of feedback, and because an open fit allows low frequency sounds to leak out of the ear canal, they are limited to moderately severe high-frequency losses.
The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound to travel to the inner ear.
A vent is a tube primarily placed to offer pressure equalization.
For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses the external auditory canal and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea.
The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.
Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal binaural hearing to preserve spatial hearing ability.
;Air conduction spectacles
Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain.
* '''Acoustically:''' the ''sound'' from the phone's speaker is picked up by the hearing aid's microphone.
The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise.
FM systems can also be hooked up to a TV or a stereo.
Generally, the case sits behind the pinna with the connection from the case coming down the front into the ear.
This digital electronic control circuitry was used to identify and automatically reduce noise in individual frequency channels of the analog audio circuits and was known as the Zeta Noise Blocker.
Direct audio input (DAI) allows the hearing aid to be directly connected to an external audio source like a CD player or an assistive listening device (ALD).
Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode.
Hearing aids are classified as medical devices in most countries, and regulated by the respective regulations.
This type is characterized by a minimal amount of effect on the ear canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves the ear canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting in the middle of the ear canal space.
However, different vent styles and sizes can be used to influence and prevent feedback.
Personal programmable hearing aid manufacturers or dealers can also remotely adjust these types of hearing aids for the customer.
