The process of converting greyscale camera images into soundscapes works according to three simple rules.
Synesthesia is now the topic of scientific books and papers, PhD theses, documentary films, and even novels.
For example, synesthetes speak of "looking at" or "going to" a particular place to attend to the experience.
Individuals presenting this synesthesia type declare that they can "see the time", for example, in the form of a ribbon, ring, or circle.
The louder the sound, the brighter the visual pattern.
People with SSS may have superior memories; in one study, they were able to recall past events and memories far better and in far greater detail than those without the condition.
on a  "screen" in front of one's face).
The third and final rule is 'dark and light': loudness corresponds to brightness.
Also relatively common is grapheme-color synesthesia.
We can think of "prevalence" both in terms of how common is synesthesia (or different forms of synesthesia) within the population, or how common are different forms of synesthesia within synesthetes.
It is one of the least common forms of synesthesia.
David Hockney perceives music as color, shape, and configuration and uses these perceptions when painting opera stage sets (though not while creating his other artworks).
Drummer Mickey Hart of The Grateful Dead wrote about his experiences with synaesthesia in his autobiography ''Drumming at the Edge of Magic''.
For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well.
sound, sight, and touch) gives patients the perception of being immersed in the virtual environment, which helps them endure the pain while relying less on pharmacological therapy.
The documentary 'Derek Tastes Of Earwax' gets its name from this phenomenon, in references to pub owner James Wannerton who experiences this particular sensation whenever he hears the name spoken.
Composers Liszt and Rimsky-Korsakov famously disagreed on the colors of music keys.
By using artificial synesthesia and combining various senses, this can help to enhance the control of a person's attention, which can be used to improve and direct sensory distraction from the perceived pain.
Misophonia is a neurological disorder in which negative experiences (anger, fright, hatred, disgust) are triggered by specific sounds.
According to Richard Cytowic, chromesthesia is "something like fireworks": voice, music, and assorted environmental sounds such as clattering dishes or dog barks trigger color and firework shapes that arise, move around, and then fade when the sound ends.
For some, everyday sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or people talking can trigger seeing colors.
Synesthetic associations can occur in any combination and any number of senses or cognitive pathways.
While converting the visual pattern into a sound, the device uses a predictable real-time audio and video processing algorithm, allowing users to listen to and then interpret the visual information captured by a digital video camera.
Normally, excitation and inhibition are balanced.
Each soundscape is a left-to-right scan, with height represented by pitch, and brightness by loudness.
Kandinsky (a synesthete) and Mondrian (not a synesthete) both experimented with image-music congruence in their paintings.
For example, the word basketball might taste like waffles.
Also, some individuals will not self-classify as synesthetes because they do not realize that their perceptions are different from those of everyone else.
Distinct from neuroscience, the concept of synesthesia in the arts is regarded as the simultaneous perception of multiple stimuli in one gestalt experience.
This study had also concluded that one common form of synesthesia—grapheme-color synesthesia (colored letters and numbers) – is found in more than one percent of the population, and this latter prevalence of graphemes-color synesthesia has now been independently verified in a yet larger sample.
Those with spatial sequence synesthesia (SSS) tend to see numerical sequences as points in space.
This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the color of a grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.
Other notable synesthetes include musicians Billy Joel, Itzhak Perlman, Alexander Frey, Ida Maria, Brian Chase and Patrick Stump; actress Stephanie Carswell (credited as Stéphanie Montreux); inventor Nikola Tesla; electronic musician Richard D. James aka Aphex Twin (who claims to be inspired by lucid dreams as well as music); and classical pianist Hélène Grimaud.
1 in 250,000) or had limitations in their methodologies because they required synesthetes to refer themselves for study (''e.g.''
Psychologists and neuroscientists study synesthesia not only for its inherent appeal, but also for the insights it may give into cognitive and perceptual processes that occur in synesthetes and non-synesthetes alike.
Many literary depictions of synesthesia are not accurate.
To the contrary, some report it as a gift—an additional "hidden" sense—something they would not want to miss.
Recent research indicated that in the background of this effect may operate a form of ideasthesia.
Little is known about how synesthesia develops.
Default resolution of the soundscape is 176×64.
There are two overall forms of synesthesia: projective synesthesia and associative synesthesia.
Even 2.5-year-old children (too young to read) show this effect.
Synesthesia also has a number of practical applications, one of which is the use of 'intentional synesthesia' in technology.
The "father of psychophysics," Gustav Fechner, reported the first empirical survey of colored letter photisms among 73 synesthetes in 1876, followed in the 1880s by Francis Galton.
In the late 1990s, the focus settled on grapheme → color synesthesia, one of the most common and easily studied types.
This variety means that defining synesthesia in an individual is difficult, and the majority of synesthetes are completely unaware that their experiences have a name.
It requires a certain amount of time and effort to become proficient at differentiating objects, identifying objects, and locating them in space.
# Synesthetic perceptions are spatially extended, meaning they often have a sense of "location."
For example, the red rocks of Bryce Canyon are depicted in his symphony ''Des canyons aux étoiles'' ("From the Canyons to the Stars").
They also see months or dates in the space around them.
The higher the position of the visual pattern, the higher the pitch.
simple rather than pictorial).
Only a fraction of types of synesthesia have been evaluated by scientific research.
Vladimir Nabokov described his grapheme-color synesthesia at length in his autobiography, ''Speak, Memory'', and portrayed it in some of his characters.
For example, many treatments for burn pain and wounds may increase patients' anxiety, which increases perceived pain.
Cytowic and Eagleman find support for the disinhibition idea in the so-called acquired forms of synesthesia that occur in non-synesthetes under certain conditions: temporal lobe epilepsy, head trauma, stroke, and brain tumors.
However, some speculate that the common phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), in which auditory stimuli or trigger words create a tingling sensation in the body without being touched, to be a form of auditory-tactile synesthesia, meaning that it could be more common than current statistics imply.
Nonetheless, there is a great variety in types of synesthesia, and within each type, individuals report differing triggers for their sensations and differing intensities of experiences.
Earlier estimates of the prevalence of synesthesia were based on "best-guess" estimations only (''e.g.''
Number forms were first documented and named in 1881 by Francis Galton in "The Visions of Sane Persons".
(I invented the colors of the vowels!
A more accurate term may be ideasthesia.
Silence indicates no light stimuli, the loudest sounds represent white light, and everything in between is a shade of grey.
Later research showed that such stark externalization occurs in a minority of synesthetes.
This form of synesthesia was named as OLP in the contemporary literature by Julia Simner and colleagues  although it is now also widely recognised by the term "sequence-personality" synaesthesia.
Technical reviews appear in period volumes of ''Scientific American.''
It has been suggested that individual development of perceptual and cognitive skills, in addition to one's cultural environment, produces the variety in awareness and practical use of synesthetic phenomena.
Her novel ''Blueeyedboy'' features various aspects of synesthesia.
Synesthesia is found in 4.4% of the population, as a lower estimate, which is equivalent to 1 in 23 people.
In particular, synesthesia might be relevant to the philosophical problem of qualia, given that synesthetes experience extra qualia (e.g.
It makes it possible for people with color-blindness to hear colors.
In existing programs, the main purpose is to reduce pain when undergoing a specific treatment by shifting the attention from the experienced pain to the virtual program in which the patient is participating.
The colors triggered by certain sounds, and any other synesthetic visual experiences, are referred to as ''photisms''.
However, if normal feedback were not inhibited as usual, then signals feeding back from late stages of multi-sensory processing might influence earlier stages such that tones could activate vision.
Some say more about an author's interpretation of synesthesia than the phenomenon itself.
The vOICe is a privately owned research project, running without venture capital, that was first implemented using low-cost hardware in 1991.
As mentioned before, one of the most notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia.
People who project will see actual colors, forms, or shapes when stimulated, as is commonly accepted as synesthesia; associators will feel a very strong and involuntary connection between the stimulus and the sense that it triggers.
# Synesthetic percepts are consistent and generic (i.e.
Researchers hope that the study of synesthesia will provide better understanding of consciousness and its neural correlates.
So the nonsynesthete will need to create a mnemonic device to remember a sequence (like “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.”), but the synesthete can simply reference their spatial visualizations.
Rimbaud later wrote ''Voyelles'' (1871), which was perhaps more important than '''' in popularizing synesthesia.
These are usually the first abstract concepts that educational systems require children to learn.
# Synesthesia is laden with affect.
New art movements such as literary symbolism, non-figurative art, and visual music have profited from experiments with synesthetic perception and contributed to the public awareness of synesthetic and multi-sensory ways of perceiving.
Synesthesia may also give a memory advantage.
The Eyeborg is a device developed by Adam Montandan that incorporates the auditory and visual spectra.
Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions may account for the many types of synesthesia.
An alternative possibility is disinhibited feedback, or a reduction in the amount of inhibition along normally existing feedback pathways.
This is another rare form of synesthesia where certain tastes are experienced when hearing words.
Joanne Harris, author of ''Chocolat'', is a synesthete who says she experiences colors as scents.
These early grew into international organizations such as the American Synesthesia Association, the UK Synaesthesia Association, the Belgian Synaesthesia Association, the Canadian Synesthesia Association, the German Synesthesia Association, and the Netherlands Synesthesia Web Community.
While nearly every logically possible combination of experiences can occur, several types are more common than others.
Synesthesia can occur between nearly any two senses or perceptual modes, and at least one synesthete, Solomon Shereshevsky, experienced synesthesia that linked all five senses.
For Deni Simon, music produces waving lines "like oscilloscope configurations – lines moving in color, often metallic with height, width and, most importantly, depth.
Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts.
The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary.
A tends to be red; O tends to be white or black; S tends to be yellow etc.)
In an experiment first designed by Wolfgang Köhler, people are asked to choose which of two shapes is named ''bouba'' and which ''kiki.''
The musical score has a separate staff marked ''luce'' whose "notes" are played on a color organ.
My favorite music has lines that extend horizontally beyond the 'screen' area."
This is a non-trivial issue because it is not only a question of a location in the brain at which meaning is "processed" but pertains also to the question of understanding—epitomized in e.g., the Chinese room problem.
Research into synesthesia proceeded briskly in several countries, but due to the difficulties in measuring subjective experiences and the rise of behaviorism, which made the study of ''any'' subjective experience taboo, synesthesia faded into scientific oblivion between 1930 and 1980.
The first medical description of "colored hearing" is in an 1812 German thesis by the German physician Sachs.
Alexander Scriabin's 1911 ''Prometheus'', for example, is a deliberate contrivance whose color choices are based on the circle of fifths and appear to have been taken from Madame Blavatsky.
Ordinal-linguistic personification (OLP, or personification for short) is a form of synesthesia in which ordered sequences, such as ordinal numbers, week-day names, months and alphabetical letters are associated with personalities and/or genders ().
Some artists frequently mentioned as synesthetes did not, in fact, have the neurological condition.
Some of the rarest are reported to be auditory-tactile, mirror-touch, and lexical-gustatory.
However, synesthetes report that common stimulants, like caffeine and cigarettes do not affect the strength of their synesthesia, nor does alcohol.
In the manner of number form synesthesia, the spatio-temporal synesthesia is a mental map of days, weeks, and/or months of the year.
This device was inspired by naturally occurring synesthesia.
Despite the commonalities which permit definition of the broad phenomenon of synesthesia, individual experiences vary in numerous ways.
This may be related to the so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.
There is research to suggest that the likelihood of having synesthesia is greater in people with autism.
It appears to be far more effective than other distraction techniques, like playing video games.
One of the remaining questions in this ongoing research concerning the vOICe is to what extent the use of a sensory substitution system can lead to visual sensations through forms of induced artificial synesthesia.
Some people see time like a clock above and around them.
Singer/songwriter Marina and the Diamonds experiences music → color synesthesia and reports colored days of the week.
Another common form of synesthesia is the association of sounds with colors.
Users are therefore advised to start training in a safe, familiar home environment in order to integrate the novel stimuli with other senses.
If there is a visual pattern on the left, the user hears a sound on the left, and similarly for the right.
Scriabin composed colored music that was deliberately contrived and based on the circle of fifths, whereas Messiaen invented a new method of composition (the modes of limited transposition) specifically to render his bi-directional sound-color synesthesia.
Difficulties have been recognized in adequately defining synesthesia.
Neurologist Richard Cytowic identifies the following diagnostic criteria for synesthesia in his ''first'' edition book.
This hypothesis – referred to as ''semantic vacuum hypothesis'' – explains why the most common forms of synesthesia are grapheme-color, spatial sequence and number form.
Dedicated regions of the brain are specialized for given functions.
Baudelaire participated in a hashish experiment by psychiatrist Jacques-Joseph Moreau and became interested in how the senses might affect each other.
Some synesthetes often report that they were unaware their experiences were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives.
Individuals rarely agree on what color a given sound is.
For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure).
An example of this is the bouba/kiki effect.
Though often stereotyped in the popular media as a medical condition or neurological aberration, many synesthetes themselves do not perceive their synesthetic experiences as a handicap.
Ordinal linguistic personification normally co-occurs with other forms of synesthesia such as grapheme-color synesthesia.
In contrast, non-synesthetes score just 30–40%, even with only a few weeks between tests and a warning that they would be retested.
Some individuals see music on a "screen" in front of their faces.
This figure was arrived at in the first large-scale random-screening study by Julia Simner and colleagues.
1 in 2000) and for this reason the authors of those studies had been moderate in their claims.
Baudelaire's 1857 '''' introduced the notion that the senses can and should intermingle.
Synesthetic composers include Duke Ellington, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Olivier Messiaen, whose three types of complex colors are rendered explicitly in musical chord structures that he invented.
# Synesthesia is highly memorable.
This variability was first noticed early in synesthesia research.
In one study conducted by Julia Simner of the University of Edinburgh, it was found that spatial sequence synesthetes have a built-in and automatic mnemonic reference.
He later boasted ''"J'inventais la couleur des voyelles!"''
An important insight for qualia research may come from the findings that synesthesia has the properties of ideasthesia, which then suggest a crucial role of conceptualization processes in generating qualia.
The device consists of a laptop, head-mounted camera or computer camera, and headphones.
One type of application is the pain-reducing virtual reality program.
Daniel Tammet wrote a book on his experiences with synesthesia called ''Born on a Blue Day''.
Thus, synesthesia may be fundamentally a semantic phenomenon.
For others, colors are triggered when musical notes and/or keys are being played.
According to certain researches, those individuals possess peculiar synaptic connections in their brain, allowing them to perceive time as a spatial construction.
Although often termed a "neurological condition," synesthesia is not listed in either the DSM-IV or the ICD since it most often does not interfere with normal daily functioning.
For example, a straight bright line on a dark background, running from the top left to the bottom right, would sound like a tone steadily decreasing in pitch; a dot would sound like a short beep; and two dots would sound like two short beeps.
Isaac Newton proposed that musical tones and color tones shared common frequencies, as did Goethe in his book, "Theory of Color".
It is estimated that 0.2% of the population has this form of synesthesia.
Like perfect pitch, synesthesia is simply a difference in perceptual experience.
According to this account, synesthesia is a phenomenon mediated by the extraction of the meaning of the inducing stimulus.
On the other hand, his older colleague Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (who was perceived as a fairly conservative composer) was, in fact, a synesthete.
Virtual reality has proven to be very effective in managing this acute pain in several medical settings by shifting patients' attention from their experienced pain to the program in which they have been introduced.
In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be "farther away" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise).
As the 1980s cognitive revolution made inquiry into internal subjective states respectable again, scientists returned to synesthesia.
# Synesthesia is involuntary and automatic.
While different individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.g.
Shifting attention from pain and anxiety is therefore an important part of the treatment process.
Physicist Richard Feynman describes his colored equations in his autobiography, ''What Do You Care What Other People Think?''
However, the criteria are different in the second book:
A very different theoretical approach to synesthesia is that based on ideasthesia.
Therefore, to understand neural mechanisms of synesthesia the mechanisms of semantics and the extraction of meaning need to be understood better.
Since real-life images are much more complex, there is also much more to hear through this device.
In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme-color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored.
More specifically, the convergence of many sense modalities (e.g.
The most common forms of synesthesia are those that trigger colors, and the most prevalent of all is day-color.
Synesthetes are very likely to participate in creative activities.
For example, perceiving letters and numbers (collectively called graphemes) as colored would be indicated as grapheme → color synesthesia.
Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation.
For example, someone with auditory-tactile synesthesia may experience that hearing a specific word feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being touched.
Sound often changes the perceived hue, brightness, scintillation, and directional movement.
Synesthetes have used their abilities in memorization of names and telephone numbers, mental arithmetic, and more complex creative activities like producing visual art, music, and theater.
The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.
Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of sensory overload.
French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire wrote of synesthetic experiences, but there is no evidence they were synesthetes themselves.
Types of synesthesia are indicated by using the notation x → y, where x is the "inducer" or trigger experience, and y is the "concurrent" or additional experience.
A is likely to be red).
Self reports, interviews, and autobiographical notes by synesthetes demonstrate a great degree of variety in types of synesthesia, intensity of synesthetic perceptions, awareness of the perceptual discrepancies between synesthetes and non-synesthetes, and the ways synesthesia is used in work, creative processes, and daily life.
The vOICe compensates for the loss of vision by converting information from the lost sensory modality into stimuli in a remaining modality.
Nabokov writes explicitly about synesthesia in several novels.
B flat might be orange for one person and blue for another.
Since the rise of the Internet in the 1990s, synesthetes began contacting one another and creating web sites devoted to the condition.
Miren Edelstein and her colleagues have compared misophonia to synesthesia in terms of connectivity between different brain regions as well as specific symptoms.
Some synesthetes report that vowels are more strongly colored, while for others consonants are more strongly colored.
Brandy Gale, a Canadian visual artist, experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of her senses – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement.
People with this type of synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population.
This is a rare form of synesthesia where individuals feel the same sensation that another person feels (such as touch).
s) are "shaded" or "tinged" with a color.
So within synesthetes, forms of synesthesia that trigger color also appear to be the most common forms of synesthesia with a prevalence rate of 86% within synesthetes.
Neurological synesthesia has been a source of inspiration for artists, composers, poets, novelists, and digital artists.
Other notable synesthetes come particularly from artistic professions and backgrounds.
Pharrell Williams, of the groups The Neptunes and N.E.R.D., also experiences synesthesia and used it as the basis of the album ''Seeing Sounds''.
Grapheme-color synesthetes, as a group, share significant preferences for the color of each letter (e.g.
Thus, the question of the neural basis of synesthesia is deeply entrenched into the general mind–body problem and the problem of the explanatory gap.
They also note that it can likewise occur during stages of meditation, deep concentration, sensory deprivation, or with use of psychedelics such as LSD or mescaline, and even, in some cases, marijuana.
