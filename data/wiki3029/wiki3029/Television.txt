The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on ITV on 22 September 1955, advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste.
Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.
It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom.
This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.
A standard, consumer grade VHS videotape can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).
Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8 million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.
The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.

In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental video signal to form a picture.
Some TV channels are partly funded from subscriptions; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels.
The most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).
Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs.
