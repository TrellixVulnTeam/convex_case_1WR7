Diagnosis is typically by testing the blood for antibodies or by testing the amniotic fluid for the parasite's DNA.
In 1974, Desmonts and Couvreur showed that infection during the first two trimesters produces most harm to the fetus, that transmission depended on when mothers were infected during pregnancy, that mothers with antibodies before pregnancy did not transmit the infection to the fetus, and that spiramycin lowered the transmission to the fetus.
This latent state of infection has recently been associated with numerous disease burdens, neural alterations, and subtle gender-dependent behavioral changes in immunocompetent humans.

There are three major types of T. gondii responsible for the patterns of Toxoplasmosis throughout the world.
There is a negative association between an infection with the parasite T. gondii and multiple sclerosis, therefore, researchers have concluded that toxoplasmosis infection could be considered a protective factor.
For pregnant women with negative antibody titers, indicating no previous exposure to ''T.
gondii'' seropositivity tests are conducted after the onset of the examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite.
The bradyzoites are not responsive to antibiotics.
gondii'', the parasite is generally eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels within a few weeks following exposure.
The toxoplasmic trophozoites causing acute toxoplasmosis are referred to as tachyzoites, and are typically found in bodily fluids.

When a pregnant woman is diagnosed with acute toxoplasmosis, amniocentesis can be used to determine whether the fetus has been infected or not.
This leads to a decrease in healthy, uninfected cells, and consequently fewer host cells to attack the infected cells.
It was not until 1937 that the first detailed scientific analysis of ''T.

Proximity to freshwater outflows into the ocean was a major risk factor.
Additionally, certain strains of T. ''gondii'' can secrete a protein known as GRA15, activating the NF-κB pathway, which upregulates the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 in the early immune response, possibly leading to the parasite’s latent phase.

In a small number of people, eye problems may develop.
Real-time PCR is useful in pathogen detection, gene expression and regulation, and allelic discrimination.
After proliferating, tachyzoites convert into bradyzoites, which take the form of latent intracellular tissue cysts that form mainly in the tissues of the muscles and brain.
Infected rodents show a reduction in their innate aversion to cat odors; while uninfected mice and rats will generally avoid areas marked with cat urine or with cat body odor, this avoidance is reduced or eliminated in infected animals.
Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no symptoms in adult humans.
Reviews of serological studies have estimated that 30–50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with latent toxoplasmosis, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country.

In the United States, the percentage of pigs harboring viable parasites has been measured (via bioassay in mice or cats) to be as high as 92.7% and as low as 0%, depending on the farm or herd.
gondii''–induced behavioral changes occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons associated with observed behaviors; for example, it modifies epigenetic methylation to induce hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly decrease predator aversion.
Most cats are not actively shedding oocysts, since they get infected in the first six months of their life, when they shed oocysts for a short period of time (1–2 weeks.)
In most cases, ''T.

An estimated 1% of cats at any given time are actively shedding oocysts.
''T.gondii'' antibody positivity was therefore considered an intermediate risk factor in relation to other known risk factors.
In 1909 Nicolle and Manceaux differentiated the protozoan from ''Leishmania''.
This is particularly useful in congenital infection, where pregnancy status and gestational age at time of infection determines treatment.
Tachyzoites are responsible for acute infection; they divide rapidly and spread through the tissues of the body.
Lymph nodes affected by ''Toxoplasma'' have characteristic changes, including poorly demarcated reactive germinal centers, clusters of monocytoid B cells, and scattered epithelioid histiocytes.

As invasive prenatal testing incurs some risk to the fetus (18.5 pregnancy losses per toxoplasmosis case prevented), postnatal or neonatal screening is preferred.
To some extent, acute toxoplasmosis infections can be differentiated from chronic infections using an IgG avidity test, which is a variation on the ELISA.
When a pregnant woman develops acute toxoplasmosis, the tachyzoites have approximately a 30% chance of entering the placental tissue, and from there entering and infecting the fetus.

As it forces its way into the host cell, the parasite forms a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane from the membrane of the host cell.
Swelling may occur at different times after the initial infection, persist, and recur for various times independently of antiparasitic treatment.
Although this period of shedding is quite transient, millions of oocysts can be shed, with each oocyst capable of spreading and surviving for months.
