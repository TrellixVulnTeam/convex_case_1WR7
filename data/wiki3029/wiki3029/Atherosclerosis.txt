Arteries constantly expand and contract with each heartbeat, i.e., the pulse.
A complete blockage leads to ischemia of the myocardial (heart) muscle and damage.
In addition, for those approaches, such as lipoprotein transport behaviors, which have been shown to produce the most success, adopting more aggressive combination treatment strategies taken on a daily basis and indefinitely has generally produced better results, both before and especially after people are symptomatic.
By enhancing miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is decreased, leading to decrease cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA-1.
In addition, the calcification deposits between the outer portion of the atheroma and the muscular wall, as they progress, lead to a loss of elasticity and stiffening of the artery as a whole.
The multiple and focal development of atherosclerotic changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and that of age spots on the skin.
Stenoses can be slowly progressive, whereas plaque ulceration is a sudden event that occurs specifically in atheromas with thinner/weaker fibrous caps that have become "unstable".
The immune system's specialized white blood cells (macrophages) absorb the oxidized LDL, forming specialized foam cells.
* PPAR, known to be important in blood sugar and variants of lipoprotein production and function;
In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts.
Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.
At the periphery of the plaque are younger "foamy" cells and capillaries.
The remnants eventually include calcium and other crystallized materials within the outermost and oldest plaque.
The actions of macrophages drive atherosclerotic plaque progression.
To properly protect unsaturated fats from oxidation, it is best to keep them cool and in oxygen free environments.
Calcification forms among vascular smooth muscle cells of the surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue.
''Immunomodulation of atherosclerosis'' is the term for techniques that modulate immune system function to suppress this macrophage action.
LDL particles and their content are susceptible to oxidation by free radicals, and the risk is higher while the particles are in the wall than while in the bloodstream.
In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.
Foam cells eventually die and further propagate the inflammatory process.
These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.
Atherosclerosis is therefore a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels due to a chronic inflammatory response of WBCs in the walls of arteries.
Clinically, given enlargement of the arteries for decades, symptomatic atherosclerosis is typically associated with men in their 40s and women in their 50s to 60s.
Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen.
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.
Peripheral arteries, which supply blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis, also experience marked narrowing due to plaque rupture and clots.
Noticeable signs can begin developing at puberty.
Non-pharmaceutical means are usually the first method of treatment, such as stopping smoking and practicing regular exercise.
However most individuals have nuisance symptoms with short term flushing reactions, especially initially, and so working with a physician with a history of successful experience with niacin implementation, careful selection of brand, dosing strategy, etc.
are usually critical to success.
The role of dietary oxidized fats/lipid peroxidation (rancid fats) in humans is not clear.
Research on genetic expression and control mechanisms is progressing.
Both anatomic and physiologic methods allow early detection before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression.
Exercise is also used to manage weight in patients who are obese, lower blood pressure, and decrease cholesterol.
But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression.
miR-33 is found in cardiovascular diseases.
Thus, greater attention has been focused on "vulnerable plaque" from the late 1990s onwards.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades.
A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008).
Herpesvirus infection of arterial smooth muscle cells has been shown to cause cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation, which is associated with atherosclerosis.
Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium.
Other studies done of soldiers in the Vietnam War showed similar results, although often worse than the ones from the earlier wars.
The result is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely.
Carotid arteries supply blood to the brain and neck.
# Calcification at the outer base of older or more advanced lesions.
As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired.
These symptoms are also related to stroke (death of brain cells).
Development of a plaque is a result of repair of injured endothelium.
A small short-term trial using bacterial synthetized human Apo-A1 Milano HDL in people with unstable angina produced fairly dramatic reduction in measured coronary plaque volume in only six weeks vs. the usual increase in plaque volume in those randomized to placebo.
If the heart attack is not fatal, fibrous organization of the clot within the lumen ensues, covering the rupture but also producing stenosis or closure of the lumen, or over time and after repeated ruptures, resulting in a persistent, usually localized stenosis or blockage of the artery lumen.
Long term exposure to inorganic arsenic is associated with atherosclerosis.
It is involved in atherosclerotic initiation and progression including lipid metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose homeostatis, cell type progression and proliferation, and myeloid cell differentiation.
On the other hand, by inhibiting miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is increased and increases the cholesterol efflux to apoA-1.
Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism.
This is the manifestation of a misrepair.
Additionally, a controlled exercise program combats atherosclerosis by improving circulation and functionality of the vessels.
Study have shown that ABCA1 mediates transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to Apolipoprotein-1 and it is also important in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, where cholesterol is deliverd from peripheral tissue to the liver, where it can be excreted into bile or converted to bile acids prior to excretion.
Within a part of arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.
Monocyte counts, as well as cholesterol markers such as LDL:HDL ratio and apolipiprotein B: apolipoprotein A-1 ratio can be used as markers to monitor the extent of atherosclerotic regression which proves useful in guiding patient treatments.
The immunomodulation approaches mentioned above, because they deal with innate responses of the host to promote atherosclerosis, have far greater prospects for success.
The accumulation of the white blood cells is termed "fatty streaks" early on because of the appearance being similar to that of marbled steak.
However, they do not affect blood flow for decades because the artery muscular wall enlarges at the locations of plaque.
# The fibro-lipid (fibro-fatty) plaque is characterized by an accumulation of lipid-laden cells underneath the intima of the arteries, typically without narrowing the lumen due to compensatory expansion of the bounding muscular layer of the artery wall.
# The fibrous plaque is also localized under the intima, within the wall of the artery resulting in thickening and expansion of the wall and, sometimes, spotty localized narrowing of the lumen with some atrophy of the muscular layer.
However, atheromas within the vessel wall are soft and fragile with little elasticity.
Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia.
According to United States data for 2004, in about 66% of men and 47% of women, the first symptom of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a heart attack or sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).
In the many secondary prevention and several primary prevention trials, several classes of lipoprotein-expression-altering (less correctly termed "cholesterol-lowering") agents have consistently reduced not only heart attack, stroke and hospitalization but also all-cause mortality rates.
These are termed "clinically silent" because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do, physicians do not recognize what has happened.
Other physical treatments include angioplasty procedures that may include stents and bypass surgery.
In another study, rabbits fed atherogenic diets containing various oils were found to undergo the greatest amount of oxidative susceptibility of LDL via polyunsaturated oils.
The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors.
Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak.
The distribution of atherosclerotic plaques in a part of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous.
Some researchers believe that atherosclerosis may be caused by an infection of the vascular smooth muscle cells.
The term ''atherogenic'' is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis.
With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes.
Therefore, we know that ABCA1 plays an important role in preventing cholesterol accumulation in macrophages.
The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin.
The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein particles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood.
Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.
These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative.
This triggers a cascade of events that leads to clot enlargement, which may quickly obstruct the flow of blood.
Some controversial research has suggested a link between atherosclerosis and the presence of several different nanobacteria in the arteries, e.g., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, though trials of current antibiotic treatments known to be usually effective in suppressing growth or killing these bacteria have not been successful in improving outcomes.
These capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the artery to enlarge over time.
See CETP inhibitor for similar approaches.
miRNAs have complementary sequences in the 3' UTR and 5' UTR of target mRNAs of protein-coding genes, and cause mRNA cleavage or repression of translational machinery.
Examples of anatomical detection methods include coronary calcium scoring by CT, carotid IMT (intimal media thickness) measurement by ultrasound, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery, causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack).
Marked narrowing of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness, not being able to think straight, difficulty speaking, becoming dizzy and difficulty in walking or standing up straight, blurred vision, numbness of the face, arms, and legs, severe headache and losing consciousness.
Abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias (the heart is either beating too slow or too fast) are another consequence of ischemia.
Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating.
The trial was published in ''JAMA'' in early 2006.
As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing ("stenosis") of the opening ("lumen") occurs.
The macrophages' ingestion of oxidized LDL particles triggers a cascade of immune responses which over time can produce an atheroma if HDL removal of fats from the macrophages does not keep up.
Hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cigarette smoking together increases the risk seven times.
Obstruction of arteries supplying the heart muscle results in a heart attack, while the obstruction of arteries supplying the brain results in a stroke.
In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating.
In diseased vascular vessels, miRNAs are dysregulated and highly expressed.
Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions.
If the combined efforts of risk factor modification and medication therapy are not sufficient to control symptoms, or fight imminent threats of ischemic events, a physician may resort to interventional or surgical procedures to correct the obstruction.
The first primary prevention comparative treatment trial was AFCAPS/TexCAPS with multiple later comparative statin/placebo treatment trials including EXCEL, ASCOT and SPARCL.
It is very difficult to measure or estimate the actual human consumption of these substances.
Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular outcomes.
A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
However, Kummerow, a prominent researcher, claims that it is not dietary cholesterol, but oxysterols, or oxidized cholesterols, from fried foods and smoking, that are the culprit.
The points labelled '+' in the following list form the core components of metabolic syndrome.
It was found in rodents that the inhibition of miR-33 will raise HDL level and the expression of miR-33 is down-regulated in humans with atherosclerotic plaques.
The sugar, cyclodextrin, removed cholesterol that had built up in the arteries of mice fed a high-fat diet.
This is promoted by low-density lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques.
Another significant location for the plaque formation is the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys.
While the statin trials have all been clearly favorable for improved human outcomes, only ASTEROID and SATURN showed evidence of atherosclerotic regression (slight).
The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media.
Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes.
Case studies have included autopsies of American soldiers killed in World War II and the Korean War.
Plaque rupture can lead to artery lumen occlusion within seconds to minutes, and potential permanent debility and sometimes sudden death.
Atherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques.
Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms.
Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.
Methods to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle concentrations, which in some animal studies largely reverses and remove atheromas, are being developed and researched.
Highly unsaturated omega-3 rich oils such as fish oil are being sold in pill form so that the taste of oxidized or rancid fat is not apparent.
Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs.
The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening.
This retention may be a cause, an effect, or both, of the underlying inflammatory process.
Besides the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease.
Monocytes enter the artery wall from the bloodstream, with platelets adhering to the area of insult.
One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle.
A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as Lp-LpA2) and free radicals in the endothelium.
However, these methods focus on detecting only severe narrowing, not the underlying atherosclerosis disease.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in blood plasma invade the endothelium and become oxidized, creating risk of cardiovascular disease.
Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries.
Symptoms for the marked narrowing are numbness within the arms or legs, as well as pain.
However, increasing HDL by any means is not necessarily helpful.
The narrowing or obstruction of blood flow can occur in any artery within the body.
The plaque is divided into three distinct components:
Beneath the endothelium there is a "fibrous cap" covering the atheromatous "core" of the plaque.
These accumulations contain both living, active WBCs (producing inflammation) and remnants of dead cells, including cholesterol and triglycerides.
Niacin has HDL raising effects (by 10–30%) and showed clinical trial benefit in the Coronary Drug Project and is commonly used in combination with other lipoprotein agents to improve efficacy of changing lipoprotein for the better.
From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing a 75% or greater stenosis prior to the vessel closing.
Sub-clinically, the disease begins to appear in childhood, and rarely is already present at birth.
Endothelial cells respond by attracting monocyte white blood cells, causing them to leave the blood stream, penetrate into the arterial walls and transform into macrophages.
# Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques.
Most of the time, patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack.
Fatty streaks may appear and disappear.
Typically, atherosclerosis begins in childhood, as a thin layer of white-yellowish streaks with the inner layers of the artery walls (an accumulation of white blood cells, mostly monocytes/macrophages) and progresses from there.
The key to the more effective approaches has been better understanding of the widespread and insidious nature of the disease and to combine multiple different treatment strategies, not rely on just one or a few approaches.
If the enlargement is beyond proportion to the atheroma thickness, then an aneurysm is created.
The majority of cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the atheroma plaque do not display any evident narrowing of the lumen.
* The multiple variants of the proteins that form the lipoprotein transport particles.
Suppression of miR-33 will lead to less cellular cholesterol and higher plasma HDL level through the regulation of ABCA1 expression.
Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade stenosis.
Combinations of statins, niacin and intestinal cholesterol absorption-inhibiting supplements (ezetimibe and others, and to a much lesser extent fibrates) have been the most successful in changing common but sub-optimal lipoprotein patterns and group outcomes.
The stenotic areas tend to become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings.
However measures which focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective.
Although the average age of the men was 22.1 years, 77.3 percent had "gross evidence of coronary arteriosclerosis".
In contrast, Prof Walter Willett (Harvard School of Public Health, PI of the second Nurses' Health Study) recommends much higher levels of fat, especially of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat.
This process is the myocardial infarction or "heart attack".
These may use synthesized Apo-A1 Milano HDL directly, or they may use gene-transfer methods to pass the ability to synthesize the Apo-A1 Milano HDLipoprotein.
While coronary artery disease is more prevalent in men than women, atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes.
Though symptoms are rarely exhibited in children, early screening of children for cardiovascular diseases could be beneficial to both the child and his/her relatives.
If the fibrous cap separating a soft atheroma from the bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released.
On CT, >130 units on the Hounsfield scale (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries.
In a study involving rabbits fed heated soybean oil, "grossly induced atherosclerosis and marked liver damage were histologically and clinically demonstrated."
Chickens, for example, develop atherosclerosis when infected with the  Marek's disease herpesvirus.
Initial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response.
Some data suggests that small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles are more prone to pass between the endothelial cells, going behind the cellular monolayer of endothelium.
Apart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen.
The extracellular matrix of the lesion breaks, usually at the shoulder of the fibrous cap that separates the lesion from the arterial lumen, where the exposed thrombogenic components of the plaque, mainly collagen will trigger thrombus formation.
Medical treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms.
Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms play an important role in the focal development of atherosclerosis.
At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing.
In addition to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the tunica media into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells.
To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process.
Various anatomic and physiological risk factors for atherosclerosis are known.
Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable).
Diabetics, despite not having clinically detectable atherosclerotic disease, have more severe debility from atherosclerotic events over time than non-diabetics who have already had atherosclerotic events.
Plaques that have ruptured are called complicated plaques.
The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke.
For example, the drug torcetrapib is the most effective agent currently known for raising HDL (by up to 60%).
Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.
Repeated plaque ruptures, ones not resulting in total lumen closure, combined with the clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time.
An indication of the role of HDL on atherosclerosis has been with the rare Apo-A1 Milano human genetic variant of this HDL protein.
Cardiac stress testing, traditionally the most commonly performed non-invasive testing method for blood flow limitations, in general, detects only lumen narrowing of ≈75% or greater, although some physicians claim that nuclear stress methods can detect as little as 50%.
Laboratory animals fed rancid fats develop atherosclerosis.
Rancid fats and oils taste very bad even in small amounts, so people avoid eating them.
On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer.
''Arteriosclerosis'' is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (); ''arteriolosclerosis'' is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); ''atherosclerosis'' is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque.
The "fatty streaks" reduce the elasticity of the artery walls.
Although the disease process tends to be slowly progressive over decades, it usually remains asymptomatic until an atheroma ulcerates, which leads to immediate blood clotting at the site of atheroma ulcer.
It is commonly referred to as a "hardening" or furring of the arteries.
Plaque occurrence and accumulation leads to decreased kidney blood flow and chronic kidney disease, which, like all other ares, are typically asymptomatic until late stages.
Both human and animal trials that showed evidence of disease regression used more aggressive combination agent treatment strategies, which nearly always included niacin.
In effect, the muscular portion of the artery wall forms small aneurysms just large enough to hold the atheroma that are present.
The muscular portion of artery walls usually remain strong, even after they have remodeled to compensate for the atheromatous plaques.
For example, statins help to lower cholesterol, antiplatelet medications like Aspirin help to prevent clots, and a variety of antihypertensive medications are routinely used to control blood pressure.
Writing in ''Science'', Gary Taubes detailed that political considerations played into the recommendations of government bodies.
The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis.
Rats fed DHA-containing oils experienced marked disruptions to their antioxidant systems, and accumulated significant amounts of phospholipid hydroperoxide in their blood, livers and kidneys.
