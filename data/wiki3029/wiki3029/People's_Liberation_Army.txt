Following the PLA's suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, ideological correctness was temporarily revived as the dominant theme in Chinese military affairs.
China also exported major arms to 18 African states.
In keeping with Deng's mandate to reform, the PLA has demobilised millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern methods in such areas as recruitment and manpower, strategy, and education and training.
* General Fan Changlong
The reductions will come mainly from non-combat ground forces, which will allow more funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic missile forces.
On 1 July 1966, the Second Artillery Corps, as named by Premier Zhou Enlai, was formed.
* The United States and the West have all along been engaged in infiltration, intervention, sabotage, and intelligence gathering against China on the political, economic, military, and ideological fronts.
It is an honoured obligation of the citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform military service and to join the militia forces."
The current efforts of China appear to be aimed at maintaining a survivable nuclear force by, for example, using solid-fuelled ICBMs in silos rather than liquid-fuelled missiles.
Military service is normally performed in the regular armed forces, but the 1984 law does allow for conscription into the reserve forces.
* Commander of the PLA Rocket Force – General Wei Fenghe
The war also served as a catalyst for the rapid modernisation of the PLAAF.
China thus produced the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history.
These activities were thought to have impacted PLA readiness and has led the political leadership to attempt to divest the PLA from its non-military business interests.
China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010–14.
While no size for the force has been revealed, there have been Chinese media claims that "over 4,000 soldiers of the force are all-weather and versatile fighters and parachutists who can fly airplanes and drive auto vehicles and motor boats".
During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996–2000) the PLA was reduced by a further 500,000.
The Fourth Department (ECM and Radar) of the Joint Staff Headquarters Department has the electronic intelligence (ELINT) portfolio within the PLA's SIGINT apparatus.
Among the deputy commanders  of a major Theater command in China, there is always one who is assigned to take charge of intelligence work, and the intelligence agencies under his charge are directly affiliated to the headquarters and the political department of the military region.
On '''1st Jan 2016''', as part of Military reforms, China created for the first time a separate headquarters for the ground forces.
Prior to the Cultural Revolution, military region commanders tended to remain in their posts for long periods of time.
Initial announcements regarding the Strategic Support Force did not provide much detail, but Yang Yujun of the Chinese Ministry of Defense described it as a combination of all support forces.
Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.
China's special ground force is called PLASF (People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces).
* Director of the Equipment Development Department – General Zhang Youxia
In 1985, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the CMC, the PLA changed from being constantly prepared to "hit early, strike hard and to fight a nuclear war" to developing the military in an era of peace.
# Office for Strategic Planning (战略规划办公室)
It controls China's nuclear and conventional strategic missiles.
Until the mid-1990s the PLA had extensive commercial enterprise holdings in non-military areas, particularly real estate.
Reform and modernisation have today resumed their position as the PLA's primary objectives, although the armed forces' political loyalty to the CPC has remained a leading concern.
The Chairman of the Central Military Commission has overall responsibility for the commission.
Ball wrote, in the eighties, that China had several dozen SIGINT stations aimed at Russia, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and India, as well as internally.
Former CMC chairman Jiang Zemin in 1990 called on the military to "meet political standards, be militarily competent, have a good working style, adhere strictly to discipline, and provide vigorous logistic support" ().
Residents of the Hong Kong and Macau SAR however, as of 1997 and 1999 are exempted from joining the military.
They were then known as the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, or simply the Red Army.
Soldiers are reported to be cross-trained in various specialties, and training is supposed to encompass a range of operational environments.
Nuclear weapons tests by China ceased in 1996, when it signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and agreed to seek an international ban on the production of fissile nuclear weapons material.
The PLA is under the command of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the CPC.
SIGINT stations, therefore, are scattered through the country, for domestic as well as international interception.
This new vision has shifted resources towards the navy and air force.
It also supplies officers to the military intelligence sections of various military regions and group armies.
From that time onward, the current system of a joint system of party and state leadership of the military was established.
It was met with very little resistance, as the spinoff was arranged in such a way that few lost out.
* Commander of the PLA Navy – Admiral Wu Shengli
It joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1984 and pledged to abstain from further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in 1986.
* Finding out and having a good grasp of the local media's sources of information on political, military, economic, and other developments on the mainland, and deliberately releasing false political or military information to the media to test the outside response.
The Navy also uses the CJ-10 naval cruise missile system, which made its first public appearance during late 2009.
In 2012, to attempt to reduce corruption at the highest rungs of the leadership of the Chinese military, the commission banned the service of alcohol at military receptions.
According to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the CMC is composed of the following: the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and Members.
They were divided into  '''15 functional departments instead''' — a significant expansion from the domain of the General Office, which is now a single department within the Central Military Commission .
The history of PLA involvement in commercial enterprises began in the 1950s and 1960s.
The 1954 Constitution stated that the State President directs the armed forces and made the State President the chairman of the Defense Commission.
Chinese military advisors and army troops were also present with the Mujahidin during training.
One unintended side effect of the Deng-era economic reforms was that many of these enterprises became very profitable.
Today, the PLA has air force, navy and second artillery leadership organs.
The leadership of each type of military force is under the leadership and management of the corresponding part of the Central Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee.
The Zangger Committee is a group which meets to list items that should be subject to IAEA inspections if exported by countries, which have, as China has, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Conference on Strengthening Intelligence Work held from 3 September 1996 – 18 September 1996 at the Xishan Command Center of the Ministry of State Security and the General Staff Department.
The older generation telephone/radio-based command, control, and communications (C3) systems are being replaced by an integrated battlefield information networks featuring local/wide-area networks (LAN/WAN), satellite communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and mobile command and control centres.
The GSD 54th Research Institute supports the ECM Department in development of digital ELINT signal processors to analyse parameters of radar pulses.
# Political Work Department (政治工作部)
# Joint Staff Department (联合参谋部)
the 1984 Military Service Law spells out the legal basis of conscription, describing military service as a duty for "all citizens without distinction of race... and religious creed".
Prof. Desmond Ball, of the Australian National University, described the largest stations as the main Technical Department SIGINT net control station on the northwest outskirts of Beijing, and the large complex near Lake Kinghathu in the extreme northeast corner of China.
While all graduates of the Moscow Institute of International Relations were employed by the KGB, only some graduates of the Beijing Institute of International Relations are employed by the Ministry of State Security.
This reflects a change in their concept of operations from primarily ground-oriented to mobile and coordinated movement of all services.
In normal times, these two communications stations report directly to the Central Military Commission and the Joint Staff Headquarters.
As long as they refrain from directly subversive activities, they are considered as well-behaved "military diplomats".
The motivation for this was that a massive land invasion by Russia was no longer seen as a major threat, and the new threats to China are seen to be a declaration of independence by Taiwan, possibly with assistance from the United States, or a confrontation over the Spratly Islands.
# The third system includes a number of communications stations directly established in the garrison areas of all the major military regions by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters.
Until the early 1990s, the navy performed a subordinate role to the PLA Land Forces.
China's share of global arms exports hence increased from 3 to 5 per cent.
Part of this process was the reorganisation that created thirteen military regions in 1955.
On 28 September 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the CMC as the commanding organ of the PLA.

Unlike other nations, the Minister of National Defense is not the head of the military, but is usually a vice-chairman of the CMC.
To ensure the absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the armed forces, every level of party committee in the military forces implements the principles of democratic centralism.
Forces under each military branch or force such as the subordinate forces, academies and schools, scientific research and engineering institutions and logistical support organisations are also under the leadership of the CMC.
One was that running profitable companies decreased the need for the state to fund the military from the government budget.
China's rise in military spending come at a time when there are tensions along the South China Sea with territorial disputes involving the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, as well as escalating tensions between China and Japan involving the disputed Diaoyu (Chinese spelling) and Senkaku (Japanese spelling) islands.
This arrangement has been especially useful as China over the past several decades has moved increasingly towards military organisations composed of forces from more than one military branch.
Beginning in the 1980s, the PLA tried to transform itself from a land-based power centred on a vast ground force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting operations beyond its borders.
The post of principal intelligence official in the top leadership of the Chinese military has been taken up by a number of people of several generations, from Li Kenong in the 1950s to Xiong Guangkai in the late 1990s; and their public capacity has always been assistant to the deputy chief of staff or assistant to the chief of staff.
Over the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles.
All of the other members of the CMC are uniformed active military officials.
The PLA then saw a huge reorganisation with the establishment of the Air Force leadership structure in November 1949 followed by the Navy leadership the following April.
The Political Commissar is Liu Lei

The PLA has started the development of an anti-ballistic and anti-satellite system in the 1960s, code named Project 640, including ground based lasers, and anti-satellite missiles.
In most cases, the management of the companies remained unchanged, with the PLA officers running the companies simply retiring from the PLA to run the newly formed private holding companies.
To date, all the participants have been selected from members of the PLA Air Force.
* Efforts must be made to strengthen understanding of the special nature and role of intelligence work, as well as understanding of the close relationship between strengthening intelligence work on the one hand, and of the Four Modernizations of the motherland, the reunification of the motherland, and opposition to hegemony and power politics on the other.
Its anti ballistic missile test was also successful.
Beijing joined the Middle East arms control talks, which began in July 1991 to establish global guidelines for conventional arms transfers, and later announced that it would no longer participate because of the US decision to sell 150 F-16A/B aircraft to Taiwan on 2 September 1992.
During the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and Soviet Russia resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing of each other's enemies.
* Northern Theater Command
The "Autumn Orchid" intelligence group was awarded a Citation for Merit, Second Class, in December 1994.
This law has not been amended since it came into effect.
This has been reflected in the two parallel guidelines for the PLA ground forces development.
Following the principle of civilian control of the military, the commander in chief is the Chairman of the Central Military Commission (usually the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China as well as Paramount leader).
China has reportedly developed a force capable of carrying out long-range air-borne operations, long-range reconnaissance, and amphibious operations.
The PLA has tested two types of hypersonic space vehicles, the Shenglong Spaceplane and a new one built by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.
# Science and Technology Commission (科学技术委员会)
Conventional main, regional, and militia units were controlled administratively by the military region commanders, but the Joint Staff Department in Beijing could assume direct operational control of any main-force unit at will.
Ma Hongbin and his son Ma Dunjing (1906–1972) were the only two Muslim generals who led a Muslim unit, the 81st corps, to ever serve in the PLA.
Air Force Headquarters generally exercised control through the commanders of the seven military regions.
Until 2016, China's territory was divided into seven military regions, but they were reorganized into five theater commands in early 2016.

China also has ship and aircraft platforms in this area, under the South Sea Fleet headquarters at Zhanjiang immediately north of the island.
China responded to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by supporting the Afghan mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang.
This shows China's shift from ground force prioritisation to emphasising air and naval power with high-tech equipment for offensive roles over disputed coastal territories.
The PLA is also actively preparing for space warfare and cyber-warfare.
The chairman of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC standing committee.
The PLA had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005.
In actual practice, the party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission.
* Minister of National Defense – General Chang Wanquan
Russia accounted for 61 per cent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 per cent and Ukraine with 13 per cent.
Formed in China's Guangzhou military region and known by the nickname "Sword of Southern China", the force supposedly receives army, air force and naval training, including flight training, and is equipped with "hundreds of high-tech devices", including global-positioning satellite systems.
The surface-to-air missile (SAM) Corps is organised into SAM divisions and brigades.
The SAC has approximately 100,000 personnel and six ballistic missile divisions (missile corps bases).
Preliminary fusion is carried out by the Second Department's Analysis Bureau which mans the National Watch Center, the focal point for national-level indications and warning.
Other significant facilities are located near Shenyang, near Jinan and in Nanjing and Shanghai.
Thus, broadly speaking, the Joint Staff Department exercises operational control of the main forces, and the military region commanders controlled the regional forces and, indirectly, the militia.
As the PLA took a stronger role in politics, this began to be seen as somewhat of a threat to the party's (or, at least, civilian) control of the military.
It includes highly trained soldiers, a team of commander, assistant commander, sniper, spotter, machine-gun supporter, bomber, and a pair of assault group.
In recent years, the PLA has paid close attention to the performance of US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The International Institute for Strategic Studies in a 2011 report argued that if spending trends continue China will achieve military equality with the United States in 15–20 years.

As of the late nineties, the Chinese did not appear to be trying to monitor the United States Pacific Command to the same extent as does Russia.
* Eastern Theater Command
Two Russian-facing sites in Xinjiang, at Qitai and Korla may be operated jointly with resources from the US CIA's Office of SIGINT Operations, probably focused on missile and space activity.
All these lessons inspired China to transform the PLA from a military based on quantity to one based on quality.
In 1950, the leadership structures of the artillery, armoured troops, air defence troops, public security forces, and worker–soldier militias were also established.
In contrast to the past, more attention is given to reconnaissance, mobility, and deep reach.
The Defense Commission is an advisory body and does not hold any actual power over the armed forces.
The Joint Staff Department carries out staff and operational functions for the PLA and had major responsibility for implementing military modernisation plans.
It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.
The CMC Discipline Inspection Commission is charged with rooting out corruption.
The "Autumn Orchid" intelligence group was mainly responsible for the following three tasks:
Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China.

The 255,000 strong People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is organised into three major fleets: the North Sea Fleet headquartered at Qingdao, the East Sea Fleet headquartered at Ningbo, and the South Sea Fleet headquartered in Zhanjiang.
It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010–14 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and for naval ships.
By the early 1990s party officials and high military officials were becoming increasingly alarmed at the military's commercial involvement for a number of reasons.
Former-United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has urged China to be more transparent about its military capabilities and intentions and Chinese state media has agreed that there is a need to "communicate more often and more effectively" about the issue.
That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organisation.
The Commander of the PLA Ground Force is Li Zuocheng

The International Liaison Department of the Political Work Department is publicly known as the "China Association for International Friendly Contacts".
China acquired military equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet attack.
Units responsible for co-ordination are the communications stations established in the garrison provinces of the military regions by the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters.
This conception of the role of the PLA requires the promotion of specialised officers who can understand modern weaponry and handle combined arms operations.
The Joint Staff Department included functionally organised subdepartments for artillery, armoured units, engineering, operations, training, intelligence, mobilisation, surveying, communications, quartermaster services, and politics.
Those engaged in professional work in military academies under the Second Department of the Joint  Staff Headquarters usually have a chance to go abroad, either for advanced studies or as military officers working in the military attaché's office of Chinese embassies in foreign countries.
The latest operational doctrine of the PLA ground forces highlights the importance of information technology, electronic and information warfare, and long-range precision strikes in future warfare.
US strategists, however, suggest that the Chinese position may be ambiguous, and nuclear weapons may be used both to deter conventional strikes/invasions on the Chinese mainland, or as an international political tool – limiting the extent to which other nations can coerce China politically, an inherent, often inadvertent phenomenon in international relations as regards any state with nuclear capabilities.
The communications stations established by the Third Department of the Joint Staff Headquarters are not subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial military district and the major military region of where they are based.
The PLA encompasses five main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket Force, and the Strategic Support Force.
Each fleet consists of a number of surface ship, submarine, naval air force, coastal defence, and marine units.

# Office for International Military Cooperation (国际军事合作办公室)
People working in the military attaché's office of embassies are usually engaged in collecting military information under the cover of "military diplomacy".
Although traditionally the Second Department of the Joint Staff Department was responsible for military intelligence, it is beginning to increasingly focus on scientific and technological intelligence in the military field, following the example of Russian agencies in stepping up the work of collecting scientific and technological information.
Between 1934 and 1935, the Red Army survived several campaigns led against it by Chiang Kai-Shek and engaged in the Long March.
As of the late 1990s, the Third Department was allegedly manned by approximately 20,000 personnel, with most of their linguists trained at the Luoyang Institute of Foreign Languages.
