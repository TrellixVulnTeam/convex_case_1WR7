Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.
This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.
The cycle of rebirth is determined by ''karma'', literally "action".
Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent "opposition to practitioners' taking medicine when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the illness through cultivation."
Some authors state that the Samsara (transmigration) and Karma doctrine may be non-Vedic, and the ideas may have developed in the "shramana" traditions that preceded Buddhism and Jainism.
* According to Professor Wilhelm Halbfass, the Vedanta school acknowledges the karma-rebirth doctrine, but concludes it is a theory that is not derived from reality and cannot be proven, considers it invalid for its failure to explain evil / inequality / other observable facts about society, treats it as a convenient fiction to solve practical problems in Upanishadic times, and declares it irrelevant; in the Advaita Vedanta school, actions in current life have moral consequences and liberation is possible within one's life as jivanmukti (self-realized person).
The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.
For example, Buddhists allowed karma transfer from one person to another and sraddha rites, but had difficulty defending the rationale.
(2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent, gratuitous harm and seek justice?
The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction.
O'Flaherty claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.
How these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of impermanence and no-self, is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed.
As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include ''pancagni vidya'' (the five fire doctrine), ''pitryana'' (the cyclic path of fathers) and ''devayana'' (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods).
Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life.
With the composition of the Epics - the common man's introduction to Dharma in Hinduism - the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories.
Other scholars suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s Demiurge.
The ''Nibbedhika Sutta'', Anguttara Nikaya 6.63:
"That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you.
#''Samvara'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
The relationship of karma to causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought.
Such peak experiences are hypothetically devoid of any karma (nirvana or moksha).
One of the earliest association of karma to causality occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad of Hinduism.
It defeats the ethical foundations, dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent.
The earliest Upanishads began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death.
''Karma'' and ''karmaphala'' are fundamental concepts in Buddhism.
Hence the ''karmas'' are the subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul.
A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent.
Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'
The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, "why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world"?
Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings."
As with karma and free will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy.
Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.
In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives - one's saṃsāra.
Those who fail to return will have no choice but to reincarnate, with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed."
The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.
For example, at 4.4.5-6, it states:
These actions may be those in a person's current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions in their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in current life, or a person's future lives.
(3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral-education because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings?
Jain texts expound that seven ''tattvas'' (truths or fundamentals) constitute reality.
Good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.
Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs, and that karma from past lives affects one's present, believe that both free will (''Cetanā'') and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.
Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell.
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (saṃsāra).
The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages.
The idea of karma was popularized in the Western world through the work of the Theosophical Society.
Rebirth, or saṃsāra, is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths.
''Nirvana'' represents annihilation of all ''karmas'' by an individual soul and ''moksha'' represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage).
Christianity also teaches morals such as reap what one sows (Galatians 6:7) and live by the sword, die by the sword (Matthew 26:52).
Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as Carvakas, Lokayatana abandoned "karma and rebirth" theory altogether.
Popular methods for negating cognitive dissonance include meditation, metacognition, counselling, psychoanalysis, etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma.
Halbfass notes, good karma is considered as ''dharma'' and leads to ''punya'' (merit), while bad karma is considered ''adharma'' and leads to ''pāp'' (demerit, sin).
He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a "setting of delusion", and return.
The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts: (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma, he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and that he merely delivering necessary punishments his "wicked" victims deserved for their own karma in past lives.
The Chinese term "''de''" or "virtue" is reserved for what might otherwise be termed "good karma" in Buddhism.
In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.
The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:
In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added.
#''Nirjara'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion with the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events.
In contrast, Hindu schools and Jainism  would not allow the possibility of karma transfer.
Disabilities, physical or mental impairment or even an unlucky life are due to the choices a spirit makes before reincarnating (that is, before being born to a new life).
# Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana.
In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.
Karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept, so suggests Creel; Karma is a fact, asserts Yamunacharya, while reincarnation is a hypothesis; in contrast, Hiriyanna suggests rebirth is a necessary corollary of karma.
According to Halbfass,
Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated.
This is the Gurbani's (Sri Guru Granth Sahib) law of karma.
In this conception, karma was a precursor to the Neopagan ''law of return'' or ''Threefold Law,'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself.
In contrast, ''samskaras'' are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones.
In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe.
The theory of karma as causality holds that (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives.
For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing Ratnatraya (The Three Jewels): ''samyak darśana'' (Right Faith), ''samyak jnāna'' (Right Knowledge) and ''samyak charitra'' (Right Conduct).
In the same vein of Li's monism, matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.
This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of Individuation or self-actualisation.
This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness.
Within Buddhism, the real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process.
A good action creates good karma, as does good intent.
Mary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to "Christian notions of sin and its effects."
This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts.
In Jainism, ''nirvana'' and ''moksha'' are used interchangeably.
The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries.
The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.
The word ''kriya'' is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, while ''karma'' is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars as metaphysical residue left in the actor).
* The Mimamsa school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards Samsara and Moksa.
The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form.
Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent - good or bad.
(3) Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (see moral evil versus natural evil).
There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results.
The concepts of ''karma'' and ''karmaphala'' explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in ''samsara'', whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the Noble Eightfold Path, shows us the way out of ''samsara''.
The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial.
The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.
The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried.
It is a concept whose meaning, importance and scope varies between Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions.
Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.
# Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them.
#''Āsrava''- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
Others state that some of the complex ideas of the ancient emerging theory of karma flowed from Vedic thinkers to Buddhist and Jain thinkers.
Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane.
When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.
In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas.
In Sikhism, all living beings are described as being under the influence of ''maya's'' three qualities.
A similar term is ''karmavipaka'', the "maturation" or "cooking" of ''karma''.
Karma is not itself "reward and punishment", but the law that produces consequence.
That is, (1) if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and (2) if the karma from past lives can determine one's future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, reduce suffering.
In the context of theory, karma is complex and difficult to define.
The mutual influences between the traditions is unclear, and likely co-developed.
In first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone's karma and assigning fate (''ming'').
* The Yoga school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one's behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.
Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts.
Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency.
Li says that "Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe.
Because Spiritism always accepted the plurality of inhabited worlds, its concept of karma became considerably complex.
Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as Vedanta school's nondualism and dualism sub-schools.
# The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously.
Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.
The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life.
A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality.
Both habits and self perception affect the course of one's life.
The ''Acintita Sutta'' warns that "the results of kamma" is one of the four incomprehensible subjects, subjects that are beyond all conceptualization and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.
In the thirteenth book of the Mahabharata, also called the Teaching Book (Anushasana Parva), sixth chapter opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: "Is the course of a person's life already destined, or can human effort shape one's life?"
It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn.
Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.
#''Mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).
Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with substitutionary atonement and vicarious punishment.
Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomena and arises from the karma of individuals.
According to Padmanabh Jaini,This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one's own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point.
Other schools in Hinduism such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.
This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence, which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results.
A ''phala'' (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life.
The consequence or effects of one's karma can be described in two forms: ''phalas'' and ''samskaras''.
Causality emerges from the interaction, actions and nature of things and people, determinative principles such as karma or God are unnecessary.
Karma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma.
In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.
Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.
The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.
''Karmas'' are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions.
Wicca teaches the Rule of Three, which states that whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times.
Benjamin Penny shares this interpretation.
Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says "It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not."
Karma seeds habits (vāsanā), and habits create the nature of man.
The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will.
Since Li believes that "karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people", Penny asks: "if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?"
Karmic principle can be understood, suggests Karl Potter, as a principle of psychology and habit.
(absence of the exogenous "Divine Entity" in Jainism)
This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be.
Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, ''jivas'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time.
Jain philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness).
How we know of this without remembering we had the choice is ambiguous.
In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with dharma and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma.
Reichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory.
Most scholars, however, consider the concept of last judgment as different than karma, with karma as ongoing process that occurs every day in one's life, and last judgment in contrast being a one time review at the end of life.
The theory of karma is often presented in the context of ''samskaras''.
If something goes wrong - such as sickness or failure at work - the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.
The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.
* The Vaisesika school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
Schools of Buddhism consider karma-rebirth cycle as integral to their theories of soteriology.
We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more.
Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving, and such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma from one person to another (that is, demerit).
''Karmaphala'' is not a "judgement" enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos.
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization.
Rather, ''karmaphala'' is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.
Western culture, influenced by Christianity, holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase "what goes around comes around".
This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed.
Interpreted as ''Musubi'', is recognized in Shintoism, view of karma as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming is observed.
The Mahabharata, which includes Hindu deity Vishnu in the form of Krishna as one of the central characters in the Epic, debates the nature and existence of suffering from these three perspectives, and includes a theory of suffering as arising from an interplay of chance events (such as floods and other events of nature), circumstances created by past human actions, and the current desires, volitions, dharma, adharma and current actions (''purusakara'') of people.
That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn't disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent.
In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, and disputed by others.
Many philosophical debates surrounding the concept are shared by the Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions, and the early developments in each tradition incorporated different novel ideas.
Their answers to psychological indeterminacy issue is the same as those for addressing the free will problem.
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the problem of evil and related problem of theodicy.
Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life events.
Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.
Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect.
Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as "bad karma".
There are worlds that are "primitive" (in the sense that they are home to spirits newly born and still very low on intellect and morals) and a succession of more and more advanced worlds to where spirits move as they are elevated.
Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma?
Some schools of Asian religions, particularly Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another.
Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory.
Different schools of Indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth.
Li says, "A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death.
Li also states that "An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick."
In the presence of a ''Tirthankara'', a soul can attain ''Kevala Jnana'' (omniscience) and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.
Halbfass explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with another Sanskrit word ''kriya''.
This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment.
In second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one's current life was introduced.
Ownby (2008) claims that Falun Gong differs from Buddhism in its definition of the term "karma" in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term.
This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching moksa.
Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits.
Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions.
What sets Spiritism apart from the more traditional religious views is that it understands karma as a condition inherent to the spirit, whether incarnated or not: the consequences of the crimes committed by the spirit last beyond the physical life and cause him (moral) pain in the afterlife.
It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process.
Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold: (1) The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action.
Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless.
The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs: (1) There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate (omnibenevolent), and (2) That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent).
Thus psyche and habit, according to Potter and others, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature.
The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.
# Jainism advocates that a soul attracts ''karmic'' matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions.
In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out, and "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."
Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort.
Furthermore, there are other schools of Hinduism such as Carvaka, Lokayata (the materialists) who denied the theory of karma-rebirth as well as the existence of God; to this school of Hindus, the properties of things come from the nature of things.
