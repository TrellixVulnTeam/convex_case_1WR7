Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a ''scaphe''.
The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22&nbsp;September 201&nbsp;, 19&nbsp;March 200&nbsp;, and 11&nbsp;September 200&nbsp;.
This was presumably found by dividing the 274 years from 432 to 158 B. C. E., into the corresponding interval of 100077 days and 14 3/4 hours between Meton's sunrise and Hipparchus's sunset solstices.
* For the eccentric model, Hipparchus found for the ratio between the radius of the eccenter and the distance between the center of the eccenter and the center of the ecliptic (i.e., the observer on Earth): 3144 : 327+2/3 ;
This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well.
Hipparchus devised a geometrical method to find the parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly.
He also constructed a celestial globe depicting the constellations, based on his observations.
The Chaldeans also knew that 251 synodic months ≈ 269 anomalistic months.
There is a strong tradition that Hipparchus was born in Nicaea (Greek ''Νίκαια''), in the ancient district of Bithynia (modern-day Iznik in province Bursa), in what today is the country Turkey.
# The Moon itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in anomaly) on a secondary circular orbit, called an ''epicycle'', that itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in longitude) over the main circular orbit around the Earth, called ''deferent''; see deferent and epicycle.
Hipparchus was the first to show that the stereographic projection is conformal, and that it transforms circles on the sphere that do not pass through the center of projection to circles on the plane.
Hipparchus is thought to be the first to calculate a heliocentric system, but he abandoned his work because the calculations showed the orbits were not perfectly circular as believed to be mandatory by the science of the time.
His results were the best so far: the actual mean distance of the Moon is 60.3 Earth radii, within his limits from Hipparchus's second book.
Hipparchus applied his knowledge of spherical angles to the problem of denoting locations on the Earth's surface.
So the apparent angular speed of the Moon (and its distance) would vary.
Before him a grid system had been used by Dicaearchus of Messana, but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the latitude and longitude of places on the Earth.
Hipparchus made his measurements with an armillary sphere, and obtained the positions of at least 850 stars.
If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 synodic months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 anomalistic months.
There are several indications that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, but the first surviving text of it is that of Menelaus of Alexandria in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery.
Further confirming his contention is the finding that the big errors in Hipparchus's longitude of Regulus and both longitudes of Spica agree to a few minutes in all three instances with a theory that he took the wrong sign for his correction for parallax when using eclipses for determining stars' positions.
He was intellectually honest about this discrepancy, and probably realized that especially the first method is very sensitive to the accuracy of the observations and parameters.
For this he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the Babylonians and other people from Mesopotamia.
Hipparchus must have been the first to be able to do this.
Alexandria is at about 31° North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40° North.
Hipparchus ranked stars in six magnitude classes according to their brightness: he assigned the value of one (today written 1,0 mag) to the twenty brightest stars, to fainter ones a value of two, and so forth to the stars with a class of six (6 mag), which can be barely seen with the naked eye.
We do not know what "exact reason" Hipparchus found for seeing the Moon eclipsed while apparently it was not in exact opposition to the Sun.
Hipparchus also observed solar equinoxes, which may be done with an equatorial ring: its shadow falls on itself when the Sun is on the equator (i.e., in one of the equinoctial points on the ecliptic), but the shadow falls above or below the opposite side of the ring when the Sun is south or north of the equator.
This has led to speculation that Hipparchus knew about enumerative combinatorics, a field of mathematics that developed independently in modern mathematics.
The result that two solar eclipses can occur one month apart is important, because this can not be based on observations: one is visible on the northern and the other on the southern hemisphere – as Pliny indicates – and the latter was inaccessible to the Greek.
In modern terms, the chord of an angle equals the radius times twice the sine of half of the angle, i.e.
Similarly, Cleomedes quotes Hipparchus for the sizes of the Sun and Earth as 1050:1; this leads to a mean lunar distance of 61 radii.
From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined.
Hipparchus’ ideas found their reflection in the ''Geography'' of Ptolemy.
The papyrus also confirmed that Hipparchus had used Callippic solar motion in 158 B. C. E., a new finding in 1991 but not attested directly until P. Fouad 267 A.
He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy.
In the second book, Hipparchus starts from the opposite extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii.
Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+½ lunar diameters.
Toomer (1980) argued that this must refer to the large total lunar eclipse of 26 November 139&nbsp;, when over a clean sea horizon as seen from Rhodes, the Moon was eclipsed in the northwest just after the Sun rose in the southeast.
Dovetailing these data suggests Hipparchus extrapolated the 158 B. C. E. June 26 solstice from his 145 solstice 12 years later a procedure that would cause only minuscule error.
The Moon also is close to an integer number of years (4267 moons : 4573 anomalistic periods : 4630.53 nodal periods : 4611.98 lunar orbits : 344.996 years : 344.982 solar orbits : 126,007.003 days : 126,351.985 rotations).
One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of 95¾ and 91¼ days.
Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not at the center of the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center.
Apollonius of Perga had at the end of the 3rd century&nbsp; proposed two models for lunar and planetary motion:
In the first book, Hipparchus assumes that the parallax of the Sun is 0, as if it is at infinite distance.
Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis and Aristillus, he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the autumnal equinox.
Apparently Hipparchus later refined his computations, and derived accurate single values that he could use for predictions of solar eclipses.
Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer and, by some, the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity.
He found that at the '''mean''' distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are 360/650 = 0°33'14".
Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. Aaboe).
103049 is the tenth Schröder–Hipparchus number, which counts the number of ways of adding one or more pairs of parentheses around consecutive subsequences of two or more items in any sequence of ten symbols.
The problem with an equatorial ring (if an observer is naive enough to trust it very near dawn or dusk) is that atmospheric refraction lifts the Sun significantly above the horizon: so for a northern hemisphere observer its apparent declination is too high, which changes the observed time when the Sun crosses the equator.
He was one of the first Greek mathematicians to do this, and in this way expanded the techniques available to astronomers and geographers.
As with most of his work, Hipparchus's star catalog was adopted and perhaps expanded by Ptolemy.
The Astronomer's Monument at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California, United States features a relief of Hipparchus as one of six of the greatest astronomers of all time and the only one from Antiquity.
The established value for the tropical year, introduced by Callippus in or before 330&nbsp; was 365 + 1/4 days.
In the practical part of his work, the so-called "table of climata", Hipparchus listed latitudes for several tens of localities.
Hipparchus is considered the greatest observational astronomer from classical antiquity until Brahe.
The traditional value (from Babylonian System B) for the mean synodic month is 29&nbsp;days;31,50,8,20 (sexagesimal) = 29.5305941... days.
The value for the eccentricity attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is 1/24 of the radius of the orbit (which is a little too large), and the direction of the apogee would be at longitude 65.5° from the vernal equinox.
For his chord table Hipparchus must have used a better approximation for π than the one from Archimedes of between 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/7 and 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;10/71; perhaps he had the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8:30 (sexagesimal) (''Almagest'' VI.7); but it is not known if he computed an improved value himself.
The random noise is two arc minutes or more nearly one arcminute if rounding is taken into account which approximately agrees with the sharpness of the eye.
Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely.
He was the first whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon survive.
Most of what is known about Hipparchus comes from Strabo's ''Geography'' and Pliny's ''Natural History'' in the 1st century; Ptolemy's 2nd-century ''Almagest''; and additional references to him in the 4th century by Pappus of Alexandria and Theon of Alexandria in their commentaries on the ''Almagest''.
the inhabited part of the land, up to the equator and the Arctic Circle.
Hipparchus could confirm his computations by comparing eclipses from his own time (presumably 27 January 141&nbsp; and 26 November 139&nbsp; according to Toomer 1980), with eclipses from Babylonian records 345 years earlier (''Almagest'' IV.2; A.Jones, 2001).
Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian.
Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving ("precessing") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century.
He developed trigonometry and constructed trigonometric tables, and he solved several problems of spherical trigonometry.
He also might have developed and used the theorem in plane geometry called Ptolemy's theorem, because it was proved by Ptolemy in his ''Almagest'' (I.10) (later elaborated on by Carnot).
The first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by Hipparchus, who is now consequently known as "the father of trigonometry".
It had been known for a long time that the motion of the Moon is not uniform: its speed varies.
He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer (against the opinion of over a century of astronomers) presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 189&nbsp;.
Recent expert  translation and analysis by Anne Tihon of papyrus P. Fouad 267 A has confirmed the 1991 finding cited above that Hipparchus obtained a summer solstice in 158 B. C. E. But the papyrus makes the date June 26, over a day earlier than the 1991 paper's conclusion for June 28.
Pliny (''Naturalis Historia'' II.X) tells us that Hipparchus demonstrated that lunar eclipses can occur five months apart, and solar eclipses seven months (instead of the usual six months); and the Sun can be hidden twice in thirty days, but as seen by different nations.
He used old solstice observations, and determined a difference of about one day in about 300 years.
:chord(''A'') = r(2&nbsp;sin(''A''/2)).
paper, in 158 B. C. E. Hipparchus computed a very erroneous summer solstice from Callippus's calendar.
In particular, he improved Eratosthenes' values for the latitudes of Athens, Sicily, and southern extremity of India.
Ptolemy claims his solar observations were on a transit instrument set in the meridian.
So he set the length of the tropical year to 365 + 1/4 - 1/300 days (= 365.24666... days = 365&nbsp;days 5&nbsp;hours 55&nbsp;min, which differs from the actual value (modern estimate, including earth spin acceleration) in his time of about 365.2425 days, an error of about 6&nbsp;min per year, an hour per decade, 10 hours per century.
He tabulated values for the chord function, which gives the length of the chord for each angle.
In this case, the shadow of the Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption.
Hipparchus's long draconitic lunar period (5458 months = 5923 lunar nodal periods) also appears a few times in Babylonian records.
It is not known what Hipparchus's economic means were nor how he supported his scientific activities.
However, such details have doubtful relation to the data of either man, since there is no textual, scientific, or statistical ground for believing that their equinoxes were taken on an equatorial ring, which is useless for solstices in any case.
He criticizes Hipparchus for making contradictory assumptions, and obtaining conflicting results (''Almagest'' V.11): but apparently he failed to understand Hipparchus's strategy to establish limits consistent with the observations, rather than a single value for the distance.
The lunar crater Hipparchus and the asteroid 4000 Hipparchus are more directly named after him.
Anyway, Hipparchus found inconsistent results; he later used the ratio of the epicycle model (3122+1/2 : 247+1/2), which is too small (60 : 4;45 sexagesimal).
He is believed to have died on the island of Rhodes, where he seems to have spent most of his later life.
Another value for the year that is attributed to Hipparchus (by the astrologer Vettius Valens in the 1st century) is 365 + 1/4 + 1/288 days (= 365.25347... days = 365&nbsp;days 6&nbsp;hours 5&nbsp;min), but this may be a corruption of another value attributed to a Babylonian source: 365 + 1/4 + 1/144 days (= 365.25694... days = 365&nbsp;days 6&nbsp;hours 10&nbsp;min).
The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself and there is no consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely.
Hipparchus is generally recognized as discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes in 127&nbsp;.
(It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus must have known them too.
Except for Timocharis and Aristillus, he was the first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes (Eratosthenes before him used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts).
It would be three centuries before Claudius Ptolemaeus' synthesis of astronomy would supersede the work of Hipparchus.
Hipparchus's equinox observations gave varying results, but he himself points out (quoted in ''Almagest'' III.1(H195)) that the observation errors by himself and his predecessors may have been as large as 1/4 day.
Late in his career (possibly about 135&nbsp;) Hipparchus compiled his star catalog, the original of which does not survive.
Hipparchus also made a list of his major works, which apparently mentioned about fourteen books, but which is only known from references by later authors.
From the geometry of book 2 it follows that the Sun is at 2,550 Earth radii, and the mean distance of the Moon is 60½ radii.
It is disputed which coordinate system(s) he used.
A simpler alternate reconstruction agrees with all four numbers.
The Greeks however preferred to think in geometrical models of the sky.
The catalog was superseded only in the late 16th century by Brahe and Wilhelm IV of Kassel via superior ruled instruments and spherical trigonometry, which improved accuracy by an order of magnitude even before the invention of the telescope.
Delambre, in 1817, cast doubt on Ptolemy's work.
This is an indication that Hipparchus's work was known to Chaldeans.
Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work on the length of the year in the ''Almagest'' III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162–128&nbsp;.
Before Hipparchus, astronomers knew that the lengths of the seasons are not equal.
However, the timing methods of the Babylonians had an error of no less than 8 minutes.
This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1').
This was the basis for the astrolabe.
Hipparchus was the first astronomer we know attempted to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits.
Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes.
Aratus wrote a poem called ''Phaenomena'' or ''Arateia'' based on Eudoxus's work.
Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146&nbsp; at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on Alexandria's large public equatorial ring that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude).
Hipparchus thus had the problematic result that his minimum distance (from book 1) was greater than his maximum mean distance (from book 2).
According to Ptolemy, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and Regulus and other bright stars.
Hipparchus's only preserved work is ''Τῶν Ἀράτου καὶ Εὐδόξου φαινομένων ἐξήγησις'' ("Commentary on the Phaenomena of Eudoxus and Aratus").
C Klintberg states "With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments I show that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables.
Not one of two centuries of mathematical investigations of their solar errors has claimed to have traced them to the effect of refraction on use of an equatorial ring.
The rather cumbersome formal name for the ESA's Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission was High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite; it was deliberately named in this way to give an acronym, HiPParCoS, that echoed and commemorated the name of Hipparchus.
Hipparchus is credited with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for a long time for naked-eye observations.
Like others before and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a noticeable parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon.
Ptolemy describes the details in the ''Almagest'' IV.11.
See Toomer 1974 for a more detailed discussion.
The Chaldeans took account of this arithmetically, and used a table giving the daily motion of the Moon according to the date within a long period.
He observed the summer solstice in 146 and 135&nbsp; both  accurate to a few hours, but observations of the moment of equinox were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime.
The 345 year periodicity is why the ancients could conceive of a ''mean'' month and quantify it so accurately that it is even today correct to a fraction of a second of time.
This is a highly critical commentary in the form of two books on a popular poem by Aratus based on the work by Eudoxus.
However Delambre in his ''Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne'' (1817) concluded that Hipparchus knew and used the equatorial coordinate system, a conclusion challenged by Otto Neugebauer in his ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'' (1975).
The earlier  study's §M found that Hipparchus did not adopt June 26 solstices until 146 B. C. E. when he founded the orbit of the sun which Ptolemy later adopted.
Before Hipparchus, Meton, Euctemon, and their pupils at Athens had made a solstice observation (i.e., timed the moment of the summer solstice) on 27 June 432&nbsp; (proleptic Julian calendar).
At the end of his career, Hipparchus wrote a book called ''Peri eniausíou megéthous'' ("On the Length of the Year") about his results.
Another table on the papyrus is perhaps for sidereal motion and a third table is for Metonic tropical motion, using a previously unknown year of 365 1/4 – 1/309 days.
Between the solstice observation of Meton and his own, there were 297 years spanning 108,478 days.
His famous star catalog was incorporated into the one by Ptolemy, and may be almost perfectly reconstructed by subtraction of two and two thirds degrees from the longitudes of Ptolemy's stars.
Ptolemy mentions (''Almagest'' V.14) that he used a similar instrument as Hipparchus, called ''dioptra'', to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun and Moon.
He tabulated the chords for angles with increments of 7.5°.
Hipparchus seems to have used a mix of ecliptic coordinates and equatorial coordinates: in his commentary on Eudoxos he provides stars' polar distance (equivalent to the declination in the equatorial system), right ascension (equatorial), longitude (ecliptical), polar longitude (hybrid), but not celestial latitude.
Hipparchus opposed the view generally accepted in the Hellenistic period that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the Caspian Sea are parts of a single ocean.
With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too.
Ulugh Beg reobserved all the Hipparchus stars he could see from Samarkand in 1437 to about the same accuracy as Hipparchus's.
This would be the second eclipse of the 345-year interval that Hipparchus used to verify the traditional Babylonian periods: this puts a late date to the development of Hipparchus's lunar theory.
Ptolemy's catalog in the ''Almagest'', which is derived from Hipparchus's catalog, is given in ecliptic coordinates.
A rigorous treatment requires spherical trigonometry, thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations.
Theon of Smyrna wrote that according to Hipparchus, the Sun is 1,880 times the size of the Earth, and the Earth twenty-seven times the size of the Moon; apparently this refers to volumes, not diameters.
However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1° too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2° high in latitude.)
He may have discussed these things in ''Perí tēs katá plátos mēniaías tēs selēnēs kinēseōs'' ("On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude"), a work mentioned in the ''Suda''.
Aristarchus of Samos is said to have done so in 280&nbsp;, and Hipparchus also had an observation by Archimedes.
Aubrey Diller has shown that the clima calculations which Strabo preserved from Hipparchus were performed by spherical trigonometry with the sole accurate obliquity known to have been used by ancient astronomers, 23°40'.
(He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.)
* and for the epicycle model, the ratio between the radius of the deferent and the epicycle: 3122+1/2 : 247+1/2 .
He also used the Babylonian unit ''pechus'' ("cubit") of about 2° or 2.5°.
Earlier Greek astronomers and mathematicians were influenced by Babylonian astronomy to some extent, for instance the period relations of the Metonic cycle and Saros cycle may have come from Babylonian sources (see "Babylonian astronomical diaries").
Hipparchus used a multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an eclipse period.
Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion cannot be solved by the lunar-four arguments that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion.
It was total in the region of the Hellespont (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with Antiochus III in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by Livy in his ''Ab Urbe Condita'' VIII.2.
Hipparchus's use of Babylonian sources has always been known in a general way, because of Ptolemy's statements.
In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus’ vision of what geography ought to be.
However, all this was theory and had not been put to practice.
However, Franz Xaver Kugler demonstrated that the synodic and anomalistic periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian ephemerides, specifically the collection of texts nowadays called "System B" (sometimes attributed to Kidinnu).
# In the first, the Moon would move uniformly along a circle, but the Earth would be eccentric, i.e., at some distance of the center of the circle.
day – as Ptolemy mentions.
Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values.
It was a 4-foot rod with a scale, a sighting hole at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon.
Hipparchus initially used (''Almagest'' 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10.
It is known today that the planets, including the Earth, move in approximate ellipses around the Sun, but this was not discovered until Johannes Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609.
Previously, Eudoxus of Cnidus in the 4th century&nbsp; had described the stars and constellations in two books called ''Phaenomena'' and ''Entropon''.
Ptolemy established a ratio of 60 : 5+1/4.
Ptolemy has even (since Brahe, 1598) been accused by astronomers of fraud for stating (''Syntaxis'', book 7, chapter 4) that he observed all 1025 stars: for almost every star he used Hipparchus's data and precessed it to his own epoch  centuries later by adding 2°40' to the longitude, using an erroneously small precession constant of 1° per century.
His two books on precession, ''On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points'' and ''On the Length of the Year'', are both mentioned in the ''Almagest'' of Claudius Ptolemy.
What was so exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly over 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only about ±1/2 hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million.
Pliny also remarks that "he also discovered for what exact reason, although the shadow causing the eclipse must from sunrise onward be below the earth, it happened once in the past that the moon was eclipsed in the west while both luminaries were visible above the earth" (translation H. Rackham (1938), Loeb Classical Library 330 p.&nbsp;207).
A line in Plutarch's ''Table Talk'' states that Hipparchus counted 103049 compound propositions that can be formed from ten simple propositions.
It is known to us from Strabo of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own ''Geografia''.
It seems he did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the geographical longitudes of different cities at lunar eclipses (Strabo ''Geografia'' 1 January 2012).
Hipparchus probably compiled a list of Babylonian astronomical observations; G. J. Toomer, a historian of astronomy, has suggested that Ptolemy's knowledge of eclipse records and other Babylonian observations in the ''Almagest'' came from a list made by Hipparchus.
Hipparchus wrote a commentary on the ''Arateia'' – his only preserved work – which contains many stellar positions and times for rising, culmination, and setting of the constellations, and these are likely to have been based on his own measurements.
Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the eclipse period to the nearest hour, and used it to confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than try to derive an improved value from his own observations.
A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator.
That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees.
(In fact, modern calculations show that the size of the 189&nbsp; solar eclipse at Alexandria must have been closer to 9/10ths and not the reported 4/5ths, a fraction more closely matched by the degree of totality at Alexandria of eclipses occurring in 310 and 129&nbsp; which were also nearly total in the Hellespont and are thought by many to be more likely possibilities for the eclipse Hipparchus used for his computations.)
The somewhat weird numbers are due to the cumbersome unit he used in his chord table according to one group of historians, who explain their reconstruction's inability to agree with these four numbers as partly due to some sloppy rounding and calculation errors by Hipparchus, for which Ptolemy criticised him (he himself made rounding errors too).
Already al-Biruni (''Qanun'' VII.2.II) and Copernicus (''de revolutionibus'' IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is actually about 5 minutes longer than the value for the eclipse period that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus.
(Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.)
With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.
It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon.
He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the equator, so if he were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument.
All thirteen clima figures agree with Diller's proposal.
It is not clear if this would be a value for the sidereal year (actual value at his time (modern estimate) about 365.2565 days), but the difference with Hipparchus's value for the tropical year is consistent with his rate of precession (see below).
He described the chord table in a work, now lost, called ''Tōn en kuklōi eutheiōn'' (''Of Lines Inside a Circle'') by Theon of Alexandria in his 4th-century commentary on the ''Almagest'' I.10; some claim his table may have survived in astronomical treatises in India, for instance the ''Surya Siddhanta''.
Hipparchus was recognized as the first mathematician known to have possessed a trigonometric table, which he needed when computing the eccentricity of the orbits of the Moon and Sun.
According to Synesius of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first ''astrolabion'': this may have been an armillary sphere (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in ''Almagest'' V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by Theon of Alexandria).
He might have used spherical trigonometry.
Prediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., exactly when and where it will be visible, requires a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax.
Parallax lowers the altitude of the luminaries; refraction raises them, and from a high point of view the horizon is lowered.
Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (3rd century&nbsp;), called ''Pròs tèn 'Eratosthénous geografían'' ("Against the Geography of Eratosthenes").
Hipparchus could construct his chord table using the Pythagorean theorem and a theorem known to Archimedes.
Speculating a Babylonian origin for the Callippic year is hard to defend, since Babylon did not observe solstices thus the only extant System B year length was based on Greek solstices (see below).
Trigonometry was a significant innovation, because it allowed Greek astronomers to solve any triangle, and made it possible to make quantitative astronomical models and predictions using their preferred geometric techniques.
