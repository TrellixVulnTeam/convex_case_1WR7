The classification of emotions has mainly been researched from two fundamental viewpoints.
Emotions are complex.
It has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.
In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance.
The emotion of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women, while fear is discouraged in boys and men.
Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time.
Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation.
Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.
In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions.
This was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.
In voles (Microtus spp.)
A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild's concept of emotional labor.
Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation, positive or negative.
* Joseph E. LeDoux (born 1949) – American neuroscientist who studies the biological underpinnings of memory and emotion, especially the mechanisms of fear.
Two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions.
Anger is, according to the model, for example produced by the combination of low serotonin, high dopamine and high noradrenaline.
The motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures.
The first viewpoint is that emotions are discrete and fundamentally different constructs while the second viewpoint asserts that emotions can be characterized on a dimensional basis in groupings.
Support for the Action Tendency Model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition.
Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt.
One line of research thus looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language  and this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse.
Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).
In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion.
The word "emotion" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word ''émouvoir'', which means "to stir up".
For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel irritation more easily or quickly than others do.
In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages.
He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience.
Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture.
Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior.
The modern word emotion is heterogeneous In some uses of the word, emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something.
* Jesse Prinz – American philosopher who specializes in emotion, moral psychology, aesthetics and consciousness.
* Barbara Fredrickson – Social psychologist who specializes in emotions and positive psychology.
The Affect theory introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion, which he called the affected system, was the motivating force in human life.
minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005).
Furthermore, research in historical trauma suggests that some traumatic emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of transgenerational trauma.
Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions.
Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion.
The Direction Model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex.
# evolutionary/biological theories,
At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on.
Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns.
In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms.
Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al.
The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.
A further step can be taken by looking at the map's dimensions of the emotional experiences.
In Scherer's components processing model of emotion, five crucial elements of emotion are said to exist.

Lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes.
* Ronald de Sousa (born 1940) – English–Canadian philosopher who specializes in the philosophy of emotions, philosophy of mind and philosophy of biology.
The idea that core affect is but one component of the emotion led to a theory called “psychological construction.” According to this theory, an emotional episode consists of a set of components, each of which is an ongoing process and none of which is necessary or sufficient for the emotion to be instantiated.
During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the "looking glass" that the gestures and reactions of others provide.
For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt.
Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al.
Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.
They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc.
), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts.
There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur.
These studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like emotional climate.
For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid.
Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.
Instead, the emotional episode is assembled at the moment of its occurrence to suit its specific circumstances.
* Affect is an encompassing term, used to describe the topics of emotion, feelings, and moods together, even though it is commonly used interchangeably with emotion.
Darwin, therefore, argued that emotions evolved via natural selection and therefore have universal cross-cultural counterparts.
In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.
Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of cortical circuits for speech.
In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states.
# power and status theories,
Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes.
In history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation.
Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions.
# exchange theories.
For example: Jenny sees a snake.
An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.
* '''Cognitive appraisal:''' provides an evaluation of events and objects.
Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions, for example, "I'm crying because I'm sad," or "I ran away because I was scared."
* '''Action tendencies:''' a motivational component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions.
In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue.
In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood.
Western philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways.
James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism.
In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways.
George Mandler provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (Mind and Emotion, 1975, and Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress, 1984)
In economics, the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception.
Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013).
The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world.
Derek Denton defines the latter as "the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behavior patterns which contrive homeostasis.
In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities.
Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion, different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently.
Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input.
He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped.
Although mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.
Many of these different approaches were synthesized by Turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.
Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals.
Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand.
# Cognitive appraisal—The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion.
Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear.
In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William James (1842–1910) and Carl Lange (1834–1900).
This theoretical frame also emphasizes ''time'' in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes— a "series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme."
This list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualise emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways.
In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities.
The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology, experience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic.
Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions.
These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map.
This still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (Direction Model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (Movement Model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (Action Tendency Model).
When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met.
Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.
In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds.
* Moods are diffuse affective states that generally last for much longer durations than emotions and are also usually less intense than emotions.
: Classic and Contemporary Readings'' (Oxford, 2003); Peter Goldie (1946–2011), a British philosopher who specialized in ethics, aesthetics, emotion, mood and character; Nico Frijda (1927–2015), a Dutch psychologist who advanced the theory that human emotions serve to promote a tendency to undertake actions that are appropriate in the circumstances, detailed in his book ''The Emotions'' (1986).
He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion.
# stratification theories, and
Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.
Moods are feelings that tend to be less intense than emotions and that often lack a contextual stimulus.
Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame.
Current research suggests that emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems.
During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular.
There is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach.
The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline.
In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans.
Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems.
* Paul Ekman (born 1934) – Psychologist specializing in the study of emotions and their relation to facial expressions.
For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.
Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.
Silvan Tomkins (1911–1991) developed the Affect theory and Script theory.
Research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see affect display).
These feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.
In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture.
Subsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters.
The affect infusion model (AIM) is a theoretical model developed by Joseph Forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.

Another line of research asks about languages other than English, and one interesting finding is that many languages have a similar but not identical term
Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue.
This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories.
If distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures.
In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant.
Some of the most influential theorists on emotion from the 20th century have died in the last decade.
Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals.

* Richard Davidson (born 1951) – American psychologist and neuroscientist; pioneer in affective neuroscience.
The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender.
For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.
Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy.
Apart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of 6 other categories (Turner, 2009) including:
The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.
The second model was supported.
Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame.
Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.
His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.
The physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions.
There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume.
With the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur.
Through the use of multidimensional scaling, psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences, which allows a visual depiction of the "emotional distance" between experiences.
Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain.
Darwin also detailed the virtues of experiencing emotions and the parallel experiences that occur in animals.
Lazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:
He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses.
One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009).
'''Emotion''', in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure.
Influential theorists who are still active include the following psychologists, neurologists, philosophers, and sociologists:
Rather the bodily changes themselves ''perceive'' the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations.
Ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media.
The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles.
; Affective events theory
Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions.
There is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, Milne & Otieno, 2007; Olitsky, 2007; Tobin, et al., 2013; Zembylas, 2002).
This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors.
Social sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions.
In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified.
Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion.
* John Cacioppo – from the University of Chicago, founding father with Gary Berntson of social neuroscience.
This two-dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect.
In criminology, a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as anomie theory and studies of "toughness," aggressive behavior, and hooliganism.
# dramaturgical theories,
The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being ''a priori''), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).
These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe.
Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures.
As James wrote, "the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, ''is'' the emotion."
For more than 40 years, Paul Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct.
In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms.
This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding.
For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.
James further claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and either we cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be."
Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.
Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion.
In law, which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in tort law claims for compensation and in criminal law prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings).

In philosophy, emotions are studied in sub-fields such as ethics, the philosophy of art (for example, sensory–emotional values, and matters of taste and sentimentality), and the philosophy of music (see also Music and emotion).
Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us.
Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition.
* Feelings are best understood as a subjective representation of emotions, private to the individual experiencing them.
In addition, relationships exist between emotions, such as having positive or negative influences, with direct opposites existing.
