At an intermediate level, the cerebellum and its auxiliary structures can be separated into several hundred or thousand independently functioning modules called "microzones" or "microcompartments".
Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells).
Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse).
Because of the way that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells.
It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1&nbsp;meter long and averaging 5&nbsp;centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500&nbsp;square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6&nbsp;cm × 5&nbsp;cm × 10&nbsp;cm.
In normal development, endogenous Sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) in the external granule layer (EGL).
There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum plays an essential role in some types of motor learning.
These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.
The largest part of it is a special structure called the ''valvula'', which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.
One of the most extensively studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response.
Albus also formulated his version as a software algorithm he called a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller), which has been tested in a number of applications.
Prior to the 1990s the function of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question.
A microzone is defined as a group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field.
The cerebellar cortex is divided into three layers.
Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate even in the absence of the synaptic input.
There is considerable variation in the size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species.
The number of neurons in the cerebellum is related to the number of neurons in the neocortex.
Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation.
The list of medical problems that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage, swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or explosives, and chronic degenerative conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy.
As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse).
After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain.
A set of large folds is, by convention, used to divide the overall structure into 10 smaller "lobules".
From the viewpoint of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex appears to be a homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from the viewpoint of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure.
Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it.
Mossy fibers project directly to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei.
In the human cerebellum, the total number of mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million.
In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome has been described in adults and children.
Such a microcomplex includes several spatially separated cortical microzones, all of which project to the same group of deep cerebellar neurons, plus a group of coupled olivary neurons that project to all of the included microzones as well as to the deep nuclear area.
(''Vermis'' is Latin for "worm".)
The Latin name is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek παρεγκεφαλίς (''parencephalis''), which was used in the works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure.
Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664.
Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect.
These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis.
In terms of function, however, there is a more important distinction along the medial-to-lateral dimension.
The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei.
The lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum are now 2.7 times greater in both humans and apes than they are in monkeys.
Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.
The basic concept of the Marr–Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a "teaching signal", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs.
Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened.
In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells.
Several theoretical models have been developed to explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum.
The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits.
All of them have granule cells that give rise to parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs.
Oscarsson in the late 1970s proposed that these cortical zones can be partitioned into smaller units called microzones.
Congenital malformation or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is a characteristic of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome.
Most species of fish and amphibians possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water.
Both views have been defended in great length in numerous publications.
Observations of long-term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial.
In ancestral hominids, and in ''Homo sapiens'' until the middle Pleistocene period, the cerebellum continued to expand, but the frontal lobes expanded more rapidly.
The smallest region, the flocculonodular lobe, is often called the vestibulocerebellum.
A narrow strip of protruding tissue along the midline is called the cerebellar vermis.
It is not only receptive fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important.
The unusual surface appearance of the cerebellum conceals the fact that most of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex.
The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells.
Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale.
# '''Plasticity''': The synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their strength.
Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive.
Studies of the vestibulo–ocular reflex (which stabilizes the visual image on the retina when the head turns) found that climbing fiber activity indicated "retinal slip", although not in a very straightforward way.
Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.
It is separated from the overlying cerebrum by a layer of leathery dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli; all of its connections with other parts of the brain travel through the pons.
This can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements.
In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.
These changes in the cerebellum size cannot be explained by greater muscle mass.
There are large compartments that are generally known as ''zones''; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as ''microzones''.
The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells similar to those of the cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally.
In addition to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships.
Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called ''rosettes''.
In 2005, Richard Apps and Martin Garwicz summarized evidence that microzones themselves form part of a larger entity they call a multizonal microcomplex.
Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.
The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.
As Eccles, Ito, and Szentágothai wrote, "This elimination in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because what the rest of the nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information."
Because of its large number of tiny granule cells, the cerebellum contains more neurons than the total from the rest of the brain, but takes up only 10% of the total brain volume.
The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved.
Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium.
They show that either the development of the cerebellum is tightly linked to that of the rest of the brain or that neural activities taking place in the cerebellum were important during Hominidae evolution.
Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy can be used to screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.
There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized.
Leaving out the flocculonodular lobe, which has distinct connections and functions, the cerebellum can be parsed functionally into a medial sector called the spinocerebellum and a larger lateral sector called the cerebrocerebellum.
The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to different parts of the cerebellum.
The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes.
Galen's extensive description is the earliest that survives.
The contrast between parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (over 100,000 of one type versus exactly one of the other type) is perhaps the most provocative feature of cerebellar anatomy, and has motivated much of the theorizing.
Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.
In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber "climbs" the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes.
The strongest clues to the function of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it.
The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.
The cerebellum of cartilaginous and bony fishes is extraordinarily large and complex.
Theories in the "learning" category almost all derive from publications by Marr and Albus.
They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds.
This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.
Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum.
A human parallel fiber runs for an average of 3&nbsp;mm in each direction from the split, for a total length of about 6&nbsp;mm (about 1/10 of the total width of the cortical layer).
The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.
Cerebellar atrophy can also occur as a result of exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.
It receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, as well as from visual and auditory systems.
The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals.
Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers.
Anatomically, the cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres.
There are two main pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.
The hallmark of the mammalian cerebellum is an expansion of the lateral lobes, whose main interactions are with the neocortex.
These cells project to a variety of targets outside the cerebellum.
Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the ''arbor vitae'' (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.
Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum.
The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum.
Each body part maps to specific points in the cerebellum, but there are numerous repetitions of the basic map, forming an arrangement that has been called "fractured somatotopy".
The cerebellum is provided with blood from three paired major arteries: the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).
Albus proposed in 1971 that a cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device.
# '''Modularity''': The cerebellar system is functionally divided into more or less independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands.
Cerebellar granule cells, in contrast to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain.
Further significant developments did not come until the Renaissance.
The  medial branch continues backward to the cerebellar notch between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum; while the lateral branch supplies the under surface of the cerebellum, as far as its lateral border, where it anastomoses with the AICA and the SCA.
Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer at the bottom of the cerebellar cortex.
Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei.
Based on the surface appearance, three lobes can be distinguished within the cerebellum: the anterior lobe (above the primary fissure), the posterior lobe (below the primary fissure), and the flocculonodular lobe (below the posterior fissure).
Purkinje cells are among the most distinctive neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837.
Kenji Doya has argued that the function of the cerebellum is best understood not in terms of what behaviors it is involved in, but rather in terms of what neural computations it performs; the cerebellum consists of a large number of more or less independent modules, all with the same geometrically regular internal structure, and therefore all, it is presumed, performing the same computation.
The AICA supplies the front part of the undersurface of the cerebellum.
If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.
The most basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed that they would be weakened.
Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles.
Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest that more than half of the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.
They continue to be able to generate motor activity, but it loses precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements.
The first indications of compartmental structure came from studies of the receptive fields of cells in various parts of the cerebellar cortex.
The medial zone of the anterior and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum.
The idea that climbing fiber activity functions as an error signal has been examined in many experimental studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt.
Climbing fibers fire at low rates, but a single climbing fiber action potential induces a burst of several action potentials in a target Purkinje cell (a complex spike).
These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei.
These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex.
Thus, the information in the granule cell population activity state is the same as the information in the mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way.
Purkinje cells form the heart of the cerebellar circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques.
This has been taken as evidence that the cerebellum performs functions important to all animal species with a brain.
It receives input exclusively from the cerebral cortex (especially the parietal lobe) via the pontine nuclei (forming cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways), and sends output mainly to the ventrolateral thalamus (in turn connected to motor areas of the premotor cortex and primary motor area of the cerebral cortex) and to the red nucleus.
A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections.
In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure.
When a Purkinje cell axon enters one of the deep nuclei, it branches to make contact with both large and small nuclear cells, but the total number of cells contacted is only about 35 (in cats).
Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, on the same side of the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum.
At the microscopic level, there are four deep nuclei embedded in the white matter.
Some manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups).
The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex.
The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone.
The circuits in the cerebellum are similar across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response.
Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds.
A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a ''dendritic claw''.
Some of these later models, such as the ''Adaptive Filter'' model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.
This outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells.
A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10&nbsp;ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes.
Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed.
Experimental data did not support the original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions.
Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning.
Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity.
They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum.
The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.
There are two schools of thought, one following Marr and Albus in holding that climbing fiber input serves primarily as a teaching signal, the other holding that its function is to shape cerebellar output directly.
Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity when there was a mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed.
In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly on the basis of these structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals.
Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses.
A clearer indication of compartmentalization is obtained by immunostaining the cerebellum for certain types of protein.
Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone.
Aristotle and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the ''parencephalis'', as opposed to the ''encephalon'' or brain proper.
Some studies have reported reductions in numbers of cells or volume of tissue, but the amount of data relating to this question is not very large.
Marr's 1969 paper proposed that the cerebellum is a device for learning to associate elemental movements encoded by climbing fibers with mossy fiber inputs that encode the sensory context.
Congenital malformation, hereditary disorders, and acquired conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function.
The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex.
The majority of neurons in the deep nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400&nbsp;μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter.
The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei.
The climbing fiber synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; this zone is devoid of parallel fiber inputs.
The most recent period of human evolution, however, may actually have been associated with an increase in the relative size of the cerebellum, as the neocortex reduced its size somewhat while the cerebellum expanded.
# '''Divergence and convergence''': In the human cerebellum, information from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells.
Each point of view seems to account for a certain collection of findings, but when one attempts to put the different views together, a coherent picture of what the climbing fibers are doing does not appear.
Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened.
(The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus).
There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures.
For other investigators, the message lies in the degree of ensemble synchrony and rhythmicity among a population of climbing fibers."
The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active.
Unless the causative condition is reversible, the only possible treatment is to help people live with their problems.
It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language, and in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established.
To identify cerebellar problems, neurological examination includes assessment of gait (a broad-based gait being indicative of ataxia), finger-pointing tests and assessment of posture.
A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell.
The SCA supplies the upper region of the cerebellum.
It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.
In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40&nbsp;Hz are typical.
Mossy fibers enter the granular layer from their points of origin, many arising from the pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc.
In at least one important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei.
If cerebellar dysfunction is indicated, a magnetic resonance imaging scan can be used to obtain a detailed picture of any structural alterations that may exist.
Damage to the flocculonodular lobe (vestibulocerebellum) may show up as a loss of equilibrium and, in particular, an altered walking gait, with a wide stance that indicates difficulty in balancing.
More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, but it was not until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained.
Most vertebrate species have a cerebellum and one or more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry.
These lobes divide the cerebellum from rostral to caudal (in humans, top to bottom).
No other name is used in the English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived names have been used, including ''cerebrum parvum'', ''encephalion'', ''encranion'', ''cerebrum posterius'', and ''parencephalis''.
Anatomists classify the cerebellum as part of the metencephalon, which also includes the pons; the metencephalon is the upper part of the rhombencephalon or "hindbrain".
This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.
At the level of gross anatomy, the cerebellum consists of a tightly folded layer of cortex, with white matter underneath and a fluid-filled ventricle at the base.
The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed.
The best-known of these markers are called "zebrins", because staining for them gives rise to a complex pattern reminiscent of the stripes on a zebra.
It receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity.
The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the ''Purkinje layer''.
The cerebellum is located in the posterior cranial fossa.
It is the oldest part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input.
There is also an analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses.
