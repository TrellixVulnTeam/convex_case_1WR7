The high pressure pump supplies the pressure needed to push water through the membrane, even as the membrane rejects the passage of salt through it.
concentration of 40 to 46&nbsp;mg/liter.
The process of osmosis through semipermeable membranes was first observed in 1748 by Jean-Antoine Nollet.
Next, it is run through a multi-media filter where it undergoes primary treatment by removing turbidity.
Landlocked reverse osmosis plants may require evaporation ponds or injection wells to avoid polluting groundwater or surface runoff.
Liming material is used to adjust pH between 6.8 and 8.1 to meet the potable water specifications, primarily for effective disinfection and for corrosion control.
Ships may use marine dumping and coastal desalination plants typically use marine outfalls.
*Cartridge filtration: Generally, string-wound polypropylene filters are used to remove particles of 1–5&nbsp;µm diameter.
In industry, reverse osmosis removes minerals from boiler water at power plants.
In the normal osmosis process, the solvent naturally moves from an area of low solute concentration (high water potential), through a membrane, to an area of high solute concentration (low water potential).
These are widely used on smaller low-energy systems.
Some travelers on long boating, fishing, or island camping trips, or in countries where the local water supply is polluted or substandard, use reverse osmosis water processors coupled with one or more ultraviolet sterilizers.
The remainder is discharged as waste water.
The concentrate flow is at typically only 3 bar / 50 psi less than the feed pressure, and thus still carries much of the high pressure pump input energy.
The membranes used for reverse osmosis have a dense layer in the polymer matrix—either the skin of an asymmetric membrane or an interfacially polymerized layer within a thin-film-composite membrane—where the separation occurs.
Thus, complete reverse osmosis systems may include additional water treatment stages that use ultraviolet light or ozone to prevent microbiological contamination.
Other plants mainly use thermal distillation methods: multiple-effect distillation and multi-stage flash.
* Remineralisation and pH adjustment
Rural people filter river or ocean water themselves, as the device is easy to use (saline water may need special membranes).
The effluent in larger volumes (more than 500 m3/d) should be treated in an effluent treatment plant first, and then the clear effluent is subjected to reverse osmosis system.
High velocity is also good against membrane scaling and successful membrane cleanings.
The typical single-pass sea water reverse osmosis system consists of:
* Pressure exchanger: using the pressurized concentrate flow, in direct contact or via a piston, to pressurize part of the membrane feed flow to near concentrate flow pressure.
This reduces flow needed from the high-pressure pump by an amount equal to the concentrate flow, typically 60%, and thereby its energy input.
, Florida became the first municipality in the United States to use the RO process on a large scale with an initial operating capacity of 3 million gallons (11350 m³) per day.
They are capable of 3 kWh/m3 or less energy consumption.
* Turbine or Pelton wheel: a water turbine driven by the concentrate flow, connected to the high pressure pump drive shaft to provide part of its input power.
To achieve higher purity a second pass can be added which generally requires re-pumping.
:CO32− + H3O+ = HCO3− + H2O
In 1946, some maple syrup producers started using reverse osmosis to remove water from sap before the sap is boiled down to syrup.
* High pressure pump (if not combined with energy recovery)
In the '''production of bottled mineral water''', the water passes through a reverse osmosis water processor to remove pollutants and microorganisms.
This varies with the salinity of the feed water and the system design parameters: typically 20% for small seawater systems, 40% – 50% for larger seawater systems, and 80% – 85% for brackish water.
A number of peer-reviewed studies have looked at the long-term health effects of drinking demineralized water.
Typical pressures for brackish water range from 225 to 376 psi (15.5 to 26 bar, or 1.6 to 2.6 MPa).
Calcium carbonate scaling tendency is estimated using the Langelier saturation index.
The material is engineered in such a fashion as to allow only one-way flow through the system.
Much of the high pressure pump input energy can be recovered from the concentrate flow, and the increasing efficiency of energy recovery devices has greatly reduced the energy needs of reverse osmosis desalination.
To work effectively, the water feeding to these units should be under some pressure ( or greater is the norm).
The use of reverse osmosis allows about 75–90% of the water to be removed from the sap, reducing energy consumption and exposure of the syrup to high temperatures.
*Dosing: Oxidizing biocides, such as chlorine, are added to kill bacteria, followed by bisulfite dosing to deactivate the chlorine, which can destroy a thin-film composite membrane.
It involves using reverse osmosis to treat domestic wastewater before discharging the NEWater back into the reservoirs.
Known users include many of the elite classed growths (Kramer) such as Château Léoville-Las Cases in Bordeaux.
Additionally, the ultrafiltration permeate, which contains lactose, is concentrated by reverse osmosis from 5% total solids to 18–22% total solids to reduce crystallization and drying costs of the lactose powder.
Reverse osmosis is an effective barrier to pathogens, but post-treatment provides secondary protection against compromised membranes and downstream problems.
Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify the water.
This process requires that a high pressure be exerted on the high concentration side of the membrane, usually 2–17 bar (30–250 psi) for fresh and brackish water, and 40–82 bar (600–1200 psi) for seawater, which has around 27 bar (390 psi) natural osmotic pressure that must be overcome.
Due to its fine membrane construction, reverse osmosis not only removes harmful contaminants present in the water, but it also may remove many of the desirable minerals from the water.
*Carbonic acid cannot combine with calcium to form calcium carbonate scale.
The cellulose triacetate membrane is prone to rotting unless protected by chlorinated water, while the thin film composite membrane is prone to breaking down under the influence of chlorine.
Reverse osmosis also involves diffusion, making the process dependent on pressure, flow rate, and other conditions.
Sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination, a membrane process, has been commercially used since the early 1970s.
Flow-through reverse osmosis systems can be regulated by high-pressure pumps.
The project was developed as a build-operate-transfer by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies, and Elran.
Household reverse osmosis units use a lot of water because they have low back pressure.
For water treatment applications, the solvent stream is purified water and the solute stream is concentrated waste.
In cellulose triacetate membrane systems, a carbon postfilter is needed to remove chlorine from the final product, water.
A reverse osmosis unit delivering five gallons (19 L) of treated water per day may discharge between 20 and 90 gallons (75-340 L) of waste water per day.
As such, the spiral-wound design does not allow for backpulsing with water or air agitation to scour its surface and remove solids.
Post-treatment consists of preparing the water for distribution after filtration.
These intake facilities are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sand/seabed formations in the area of source water extraction.
In addition to inhibiting carbonate and phosphate scales, antiscalants inhibit sulfate and fluoride scales and disperse colloids and metal oxides.
In addition to desalination, reverse osmosis is a more economical operation for concentrating food liquids (such as fruit juices) than conventional heat-treatment processes.
In whey applications, the whey (liquid remaining after cheese manufacture) is concentrated with reverse osmosis from 6% total solids to 10–20% total solids before ultrafiltration processing.
It is then pumped through a cartridge filter which is usually spiral-wound cotton.
Its advantages include a lower operating cost and the ability to avoid heat-treatment processes, which makes it suitable for heat-sensitive substances such as the protein and enzymes found in most food products.
The recovery of purified water depends upon various factors, including membrane sizes, membrane pore size, temperature, operating pressure, and membrane surface area.
These are widely used on larger low-energy systems.
* Energy recovery (if used)
The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side.
This process is best known for its use in desalination (removing the salt and other minerals from sea water to get fresh water), but since the early 1970s, it has also been used to purify fresh water for medical, industrial, and domestic applications.
There are also biofouling inhibitors, which do not kill bacteria, but simply prevent them from growing slime on the membrane surface and plant walls.
Ordinary tap water can contain excessive chlorine, chloramines, copper, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, silicates, or many other chemicals detrimental to the sensitive organisms in a reef environment.
:HCO3− + H3O+ = H2CO3 + H2O
However, key differences are found between reverse osmosis and filtration.
In the case of seawater, they range from 800 to 1,180 psi (55 to 81.5 bar or 6 to 8 MPa).
Raw seawater collected using beach wells is often of better quality in terms of solids, silt, oil and grease, natural organic contamination and aquatic microorganisms, compared to open seawater intakes.
The water is distilled multiple times.
Devices used, in order of invention, are:
The Lightweight Water Purification Systems can be transported by Humvee and filters  per hour.
There are many models in use by the United States armed forces and the Canadian Forces.
Therefore, pretreatment is a necessity for any reverse osmosis or nanofiltration system.
Antiscalants can control acid-soluble scales at a fraction of the dosage required to control the same scale using sulfuric acid.
Since accumulated material cannot be removed from the membrane surface systems, they are highly susceptible to fouling (loss of production capacity).
Energy recovery can reduce energy consumption by 50% or more.
Areas that have either no or limited surface water or groundwater may choose to desalinate.
It is also used to clean effluent and brackish groundwater.
John Cadotte, of FilmTec Corporation, discovered that membranes with particularly high flux and low salt passage could be made by interfacial polymerization of ''m''-phenylene diamine and trimesoyl chloride.
It has an output of 624,000 m³/day.
The clarified water is then fed through a high-pressure piston pump into a series of vessels where it is subject to reverse osmosis.
Adding too much sulfuric acid to control carbonate scales may result in calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, or strontium sulfate scale formation on the reverse osmosis membrane.
* Energy recovery pump: a reciprocating piston pump having the pressurized concentrate flow applied to one side of each piston to help drive the membrane feed flow from the opposite side.
In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property, that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent, a thermodynamic parameter.
Microfiltration removes particles of 50&nbsp;nm or larger.
Reverse osmosis is extensively used in the dairy industry for the production of whey protein powders and for the concentration of milk to reduce shipping costs.
These are the simplest energy recovery devices to apply, combining the high pressure pump and energy recovery in a single self-regulating unit.
For food concentration applications, the concentrated solute stream is the product and the solvent stream is waste.
Positive displacement axial piston motors have also been used in place of turbines on smaller systems.
Although this process has proved to be costly and not very convenient if it is intended to meet mineral demand by humans and plants.
Where energy recovery is used, part of the high pressure pump's work is done by the energy recovery device, reducing the system energy inputs.
The percentage of desalinated water produced versus the saline water feed flow is known as the "recovery ratio".
It must be as pure as possible so it does not leave deposits on the machinery or cause corrosion.
Wastewater is typically connected to the house drains and will add to the load on the household septic system.
Almost all commercial reverse osmosis membrane is now made by this method.
Disinfection by means of ultra violet (UV) lamps (sometimes called germicidal or bactericidal) may be employed to sterilize pathogens which bypassed the reverse osmosis process.
To be "selective", this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the pores (holes), but should allow smaller components of the solution (such as solvent molecules) to pass freely.
The desalinated water purity is a function of the feed water salinity, membrane selection and recovery ratio.
Up to 50% of the seawater input can be recovered as fresh water, though lower recoveries may reduce membrane fouling and energy consumption.
Because no heating or phase changes are needed, energy requirements are low, around 3 kWh/m3, in comparison to other processes of desalination, but are still much higher than those required for other forms of water supply, including reverse osmosis treatment of wastewater, at 0.1 to 1 kWh/m3.
For small-scale hydrogen production, reverse osmosis is sometimes used to prevent formation of minerals on the surface of electrodes.
*Some small scale desalination units use 'beach wells'; they are usually drilled on the seashore in close vicinity to the ocean.
Chlorination or chloramination (chlorine and ammonia) protects against pathogens which may have lodged in the distribution system downstream, such as from new construction, backwash, compromised pipes, etc.
Where chlorine and chloramines are found in the water, carbon filtration is needed before the membrane, as the common residential membrane used by reef keepers does not cope with these compounds.
The remaining "concentrate" flow passes along the saline side of the membrane to flush away the concentrated salt solution.
*Prefiltration pH adjustment: If the pH, hardness and the alkalinity in the feedwater result in a scaling tendency when they are concentrated in the reject stream, acid is dosed to maintain carbonates in their soluble carbonic acid form.
Up to 80% of the feed water input can be recovered as fresh water, depending on feed salinity.
As a result, they recover only 5 to 15% of the water entering the system.
Cadotte's patent on this process was the subject of litigation and has since expired.
The membrane assembly consists of a pressure vessel with a membrane that allows feedwater to be pressed against it.
The Ashkelon sea water reverse osmosis desalination plant in Israel is the largest in the world.
The driving force for the movement of the solvent is the reduction in the free energy of the system when the difference in solvent concentration on either side of a membrane is reduced, generating osmotic pressure due to the solvent moving into the more concentrated solution.
Each branch of the United States armed forces has their own series of reverse osmosis water purification unit models, but they are all similar.
In 1950, the University of California at Los Angeles  first investigated desalination of seawater using semipermeable membranes.
An effective combination of both reverse osmosis and deionization is the most popular among reef aquarium keepers, and is preferred above other water purification processes due to the low cost of ownership and minimal operating costs.
According to the International Desalination Association, for 2011, reverse osmosis was used in 66% of installed desalination capacity (44.5 of 67.4 Mm3/day), and nearly all new plants.

* Turbocharger: a water turbine driven by the concentrate flow, directly connected to a centrifugal pump which boosts the high pressure pump output pressure, reducing the pressure needed from the high pressure pump and thereby its energy input, similar in construction principle to car engine turbochargers.
Particle filtration removes particles of  or larger.
'''Reverse osmosis''' ('''RO''') is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove ions,  molecules, and larger particles from drinking water.
Sometimes, beach intakes may also yield source water of lower salinity.
Pretreatment is important when working with reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes due to the nature of their spiral-wound design.
Treatment cost is reduced significantly and membrane life of the reverse osmosis system is increased.
In practice, a fraction of the living bacteria can and do pass through reverse osmosis membranes through minor imperfections, or bypass the membrane entirely through tiny leaks in surrounding seals.
It is also the cheapest and will sell water to the authorities for US$0.58/m³.
*Screening of solids: Solids within the water must be removed and the water treated to prevent fouling of the membranes by fine particle or biological growth, and reduce the risk of damage to high-pressure pump components.
The Tactical Water Purification Systems can be carried on a Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement truck, and can filter  per hour.
Only a part of the saline feed water pumped into the membrane assembly passes through the membrane with the salt removed.
Because waste water carries with it the rejected contaminants, methods to recover this water are not practical for household systems.
For the following 200 years, osmosis was only a phenomenon observed in the laboratory.

A boost pump then raises this pressure by typically 3 bar / 50 psi to the membrane feed pressure.
Research has been done on concentration of orange juice and tomato juice.
The very same mineral demand that freshwater sources provided previously.
This process clarifies the water of any particles larger than  and eliminates almost all turbidity.
Designed for military use, it can provide potable water from nearly any water source.
The predominant removal mechanism in membrane filtration is straining, or size exclusion, so the process can theoretically achieve perfect efficiency regardless of parameters such as the solution's pressure and concentration.
This requires a large amount of energy.
An increasingly popular method of cleaning windows is the so-called "water-fed pole" system.
The membrane must be strong enough to withstand whatever pressure is applied against it.
In most cases, the membrane is designed to allow only water to pass through this dense layer, while preventing the passage of solutes (such as salt ions).
* Membrane assembly
Treatment with reverse osmosis is limited, resulting in low recoveries on high concentration (measured with electrical conductivity) and fouling of the RO membranes.
Due to the cross-flow with high velocity is given by a flow booster pump, what is recirculating the flow over the same membrane surface between 1,5 and 3 times before is released as a concentrate.
Its first practical use was demonstrated by Sidney Loeb from University of California at Los Angeles in Coalinga, California, and Srinivasa Sourirajan of National Research council, Canada.
Within the United States Marine Corps, the reverse osmosis water purification unit has been replaced by both the Lightweight Water Purification System and Tactical Water Purification Systems.
Microbial contamination and degradation of the membranes must be monitored.
A level of 500 ppm is generally accepted as the upper limit for drinking water, while the US Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 ppm.
By the end of 2001, about 15,200 desalination plants were in operation or in the planning stages, worldwide.
*Prefiltration antiscalants: Scale inhibitors (also known as antiscalants) prevent formation of all scales compared to acid, which can only prevent formation of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate scales.
This is still lower than the 45 to 60&nbsp;mg/liter found in typical Israeli freshwaters.
Purity expressed as total dissolved solids typically varies from 100 to 400 parts per million (ppm or milligram/litre)on a seawater feed.
Despite claims that antiscalants can inhibit silica formation, no concrete evidence proves that silica polymerization can be inhibited by antiscalants.
Ultrafiltration removes particles of roughly 3&nbsp;nm or larger.
It is then disinfected with chlorine and stored for later use.
'''Portable reverse osmosis water processors''' are sold for personal water purification in various locations.
Instead of washing the windows with detergent in the conventional way, they are scrubbed with highly purified water, typically containing less than 10 ppm dissolved solids, using a brush on the end of a long pole which is wielded from ground level.
Membrane pore sizes can vary from 0.1 to 5,000&nbsp;nm (4×10−9 to 2×10−4 in) depending on filter type.
Reverse osmosis applicability is limited by conductivity, organics, and scaling inorganic elements such as CaSO4, Si, Fe and Ba.
Many reef aquarium keepers use reverse osmosis systems for their artificial mixture of seawater.
In European countries, though, such processing of natural mineral water (as defined by a European Directive) is not allowed under European law.
Reverse osmosis membranes are made in a variety of configurations, with the two most common configurations being spiral-wound and hollow-fiber.
The process is similar to other membrane technology applications.

Remineralisation may be needed to replace minerals removed from the water by desalination.
After farmers used this water, magnesium deficiency symptoms appeared in crops, including tomatoes, basil, and flowers, and had to be remedied by fertilization.
The process is substantially the same as sea water reverse osmosis, but requires lower pressures and therefore less energy.
The desalinated water is "stabilized" to protect downstream pipelines and storage, usually by adding lime or caustic to prevent corrosion of concrete-lined surfaces.
They are capable of 3 kWh/m3 or less energy consumption.
Brackish water reverse osmosis refers to desalination of water with a lower salt content than sea water, usually from river estuaries or saline wells.

The solvent waste stream from food processing may be used as reclaimed water, but there may be fewer options for disposal of a concentrated waste solute stream.
Large-scale industrial/municipal systems recover typically 75% to 80% of the feed water, or as high as 90%, because they can generate the high pressure needed for higher recovery reverse osmosis filtration.
Pretreatment in sea water reverse osmosis systems has four major components:
The deposits inside or outside the boiler tubes may result in underperformance of the boiler, bringing down its efficiency and resulting in poor steam production, hence poor power production at the turbine.
Some models are containerized, some are trailers, and some are vehicles unto themselves.
