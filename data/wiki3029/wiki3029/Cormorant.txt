* Great cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax carbo''
Such a scenario would account for the present-day distribution of cormorants and shags and is not contradicted by the fossil record; as remarked above, a thorough review of the problem is not yet available.

When removed from San Nicolas, she brought with her a green cormorant dress she made; this dress is reported to have been removed to the Vatican.
This latter group is certainly not a natural one, and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct, the remaining Pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic.
:A well-supported marine group ranging from the Bering Strait to California.
Cormorants feature in heraldry and medieval ornamentation, usually in their "wing-drying" pose, which was seen as representing the Christian cross, and symbolizing nobility and sacrifice.
They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters – indeed, the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a fresh-water bird.
A Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, c. 66 mya) right femur, AMNH FR 25272 from the Lance Formation near Lance Creek, Wyoming, is sometimes suggested to be the second-oldest record of the Phalacrocoracidae; this was from a rather smaller bird, about the size of a long-tailed cormorant.
* Otago shag or bronze shag, ''Phalacrocorax chalconotus''
Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant in one part of the world and a shag in another, e.g., the great cormorant is called the black shag in New Zealand (the birds found in Australasia have a crest that is absent in European members of the species).
* ''Phalacrocorax'' sp.
:Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and southern Africa.
However, the closest living relatives of the cormorants and shags are the other families of the suborder Sulae—darters and gannets and boobies—which have a primarily Gondwanan distribution.
** Heard Island shag, ''Phalacrocorax (atriceps) nivalis''
Perched atop the Tree of Life, Satan took the form of a cormorant as he spied on Adam and Eve during his first intrusion into Eden.
It has a highly apomorphic colour pattern: naked red base of bill, red feet, and a white neck spot, and it is crestless.
During the late Paleogene, when the family presumably originated, much of Eurasia was covered by shallow seas, as the Indian Plate finally attached to the mainland.
The French explorer André Thévet commented in 1558, "...the beak is similar to that of a cormorant or other corvid," which demonstrates that the erroneous belief that the birds were related to ravens lasted at least to the 16th century.
* ''Phalacrocorax'' sp.
This is often thought to refer to the creamy white patch on the cheeks of adult great cormorants, or the ornamental white head plumes prominent in Mediterranean birds of this species, but is certainly not a unifying characteristic of cormorants.
Their feet have webbing between all four toes.
Cormorants nest in colonies around the shore, on trees, islets or cliffs.
They are black-footed and have white ornamental plumes strewn about the head and neck in breeding plumage.
* White-breasted cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax lucidus''

* Cape cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax capensis''
A cormorant representing Blanche Ingram appears in the first of the fictional paintings by Jane in Charlotte Brontë's novel ''Jane Eyre''.
Lacking a detailed study, it may well be that the first "modern" cormorants were small species from eastern, south-eastern or southern Asia, possibly living in freshwater habitat, that dispersed due to tectonic events.
When the bird captures and tries to swallow a large fish, the fish is caught in the bird's throat.
The wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but commonly in the Antarctic shags and red-legged cormorants.
The supposed Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene ''"Valenticarbo"'' is a ''nomen dubium'' and given its recent age probably not a separate genus.
Cormoran is the Cornish name of the sea giant in the tale of Jack the Giant Killer.

Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and Sulidae (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the pelicans or even penguins, than to all other living birds.
* Imperial shag or blue-eyed shag, ''Phalacrocorax atriceps''
The proposed genus ''Oligocorax'' appears to be paraphyletic – the European species have been separated in ''Nectornis'', and the North American ones are placed in the expanded ''Phalacrocorax''.
Still others suggests that the outer plumage absorbs water but does not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin.

* European shag, ''Phalacrocorax aristotelis''
A detailed study of the great cormorant concludes that it is without doubt to dry the plumage.
The genus name ''Leucocarbo'' would apply to either this group, or the entire clade.
Two distinct genera of prehistoric cormorants are widely accepted today, if ''Phalacrocorax'' is used for all living species:
* Red-faced cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax urile''
Third, this scheme is also used by the IUCN, making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation.
* ''Phalacrocorax filyawi''  (Pinecrest Late Pliocene of Florida, US) – may be ''P.
The former ''"Phalacrocorax"'' (or ''"Oligocorax"'') ''mediterraneus'' is now considered to belong to the bathornithid ''Paracrax antiqua''.

* ''Nectornis'' (Late Oligocene/Early Miocene of Central Europe – Middle Miocene of Bes-Konak, Turkey) – includes ''Oligocorax miocaenus''
* Spotted shag ''Phalacrocorax punctatus''
They dive from the surface, though many species make a characteristic half-jump as they dive, presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water.

* Crowned cormorant, ''Microcarbo coronatus''
* ''Phalacrocorax marinavis'' (Oligocene – Early Miocene of Oregon, US) – formerly ''Oligocorax''
* Campbell shag, ''Phalacrocorax campbelli''
Archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing was practiced in Ancient Egypt, Peru, Korea and India, but the strongest tradition has remained in China and Japan, where it reached commercial-scale level in some areas.
:Highly plesiomorphic among its relatives; a species from the southern coasts of Africa.
** Antarctic shag, ''Phalacrocorax (atriceps) bransfieldensis''
Under water they propel themselves with their feet, though some also propel themselves with their wings (see the picture, commentary  and existing reference video ).
* ''Phalacrocorax femoralis'' (Modelo Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of WC North America) – formerly ''Miocorax''
'''Phalacrocoracidae''' is a family of some 40 species of aquatic birds commonly known as '''cormorants''' and '''shags'''.
The taxa in question are:
Some Late Cretaceous fossils have been proposed to belong with the Phalacrocoracidae:
''"P." subvolans'' was actually a darter (''Anhinga'').
'''Cape cormorant:''' sometimes placed in ''Leucocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae")
As other species were discovered by English-speaking sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, depending on whether they had crests or not.
* Flightless cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax harrisi''
:Small, short-billed subtropical to tropical marine and freshwater species from the Old World and Australia.
(Jebel Qatrani Early Oligocene of Fayum, Egypt)  – similar to ''Piscator''?
In accordance with the treatment there, the imperial shag complex is here left unsplit as well, but the king shag complex has been.
Their relationships and delimitation – apart from being part of a "higher waterfowl" clade which is similar but not identical to Sibley and Ahlquist's "pan-Ciconiiformes" – remain mostly unresolved.
The cormorants are a group traditionally placed within the Pelecaniformes or, in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy, the expanded Ciconiiformes.

In Japan, cormorant fishing is called ''ukai'' (鵜飼).
John Milton in ''Paradise Lost'' satirized the concept, using cormorant as a disguise used by Satan, symbolizing greed.
:A superspecies of the New Zealand region.
The proposed division into ''Phalacrocorax sensu stricto'' (or subfamily ''Phalacrocoracinae'') cormorants and ''Leucocarbo sensu lato'' (or ''Leucocarboninae'') shags does indeed have some degree of merit – though not as originally intended – but fails to account for basal lineages and the fact that the entire family cannot be clearly divided at present beyond the superspecies or species-complex level.
Some sources state that cormorants have waterproof feathers while others say that they have water ''permeable'' feathers.
They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands.
They tend to have prominent double crests.
They have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird.
In recent years, three preferred treatments of the cormorant family have emerged: either to leave all living cormorants in a single genus, ''Phalacrocorax'', or to split off a few species such as the imperial shag complex (in ''Leucocarbo'') and perhaps the flightless cormorant.
It is apparently close to the common ancestor of the next group and, perhaps apart from the all-black plumage, looks almost identical to that long-extinct bird.
Alternate functions suggested for the spread-wing posture include that it aids thermoregulation, digestion, balances the bird or indicates presence of fish.
:This reasonably well-supported marine clade contains three lineages:
In fact, the earliest known modern bird, ''Gansus yumenensis'', had essentially the same structure.
* ''Phalacrocorax mongoliensis'' (Late Pliocene of W Mongolia)
* Neotropic cormorant or olivaceous cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax brasilianus''
* ''Phalacrocorax wetmorei'' (Bone Valley Early Pliocene of Florida)
Several different classifications of the family have been proposed recently, and the number of genera is disputed.
Pending a thorough review of the Recent and prehistoric cormorants, the single-genus approach is followed here for three reasons: first, it is preferable to tentatively assigning genera without a robust hypothesis.
* ''Phalacrocorax intermedius'' (Early – Middle Miocene of C Europe) – includes ''P.
* ''Phalacrocorax'' sp.
As the Early Oligocene ''Sula" ronzoni'' cannot be assigned to any of the suloid families—cormorants and shags, darters, and gannets and boobies—with certainty, the best interpretation is that the Phalacrocoracidae diverged from their closest ancestors in the Early Oligocene, perhaps some 30 million years ago, and that the Cretaceous fossils represent ancestral suloids, "pelecaniforms" or "higher waterbirds"; at least the last lineage is generally believed to have been already distinct and undergoing evolutionary radiation at the end of the Cretaceous.
All species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface.
''Hypoleucos'' would be the correct genus name if they were split off.
Van Tets (1976) proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name "cormorant" to one and "shag" to the other, but this flies in the face of common usage and has not been widely adopted.
They have black feet and almost all lack significant white feathers.
All are fish-eaters, dining on small eels, fish, and even water snakes.
* ''Phalacrocorax macropus'' (Early Miocene – Pliocene of north-west US)
Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large birds, with body weight in the range of  and wing span of .
After fishing, cormorants go ashore, and are frequently seen holding their wings out in the sun.
If the distinction into subfamilies would be upheld, the "blue-eyed" and related species would probably be the ''Leucocarboninae'', and the groups that follow them the ''Phalacrocoracinae''.
There is no consistent distinction between "cormorants" and "shags" as these appellations have been assigned to different species randomly.
The majority, including nearly all Northern Hemisphere species, have mainly dark plumage, but some Southern Hemisphere species are black and white, and a few (e.g.
The species she described may have been the pelagic cormorant, which is the only species in the temperate U.S. with the "slim head&nbsp;... vermilion-strapped" and "big black feet" that she mentions.

* Reed cormorant, ''Microcarbo africanus''
The method is not as common today, since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed, but is still practiced as a cultural tradition.
* ''Phalacrocorax vetustus'' (Late Pleistocene of Australia) – formerly ''Australocorax'', possibly not a valid species
Similarly, the origin of the family is shrouded in uncertainties.
They are characteristic, being large, with white cheek and thigh patches, ornamental plumes in the neck, a yellow naked bill base, black feet, and a shaggy nape crest.
Most species are tentatively assigned here, based on the combination of range, crestlessness, size, general lack of naked skin ornaments and the presence of some amount of white feathering in the ear region at least in breeding plumage.
Several evolutionary groups are still recognizable.
The crested shags with yellow warts in front of the eyes belong to this group.
:One containing American species which are mainly black-footed, black-plumaged, and have yellow skin at the base of the bill as well as white display crests behind the eyes in breeding plumage.

This list attempts to follow a phylogenetic order.
* Black-faced cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax fuscescens'' – tentatively placed here
"Shag" refers to the bird's crest, which the British forms of the great cormorant lack.
They often have a diminutive frontal tuft.
In 1853, a woman wearing a dress made of cormorant feathers was found on San Nicolas Island, off the southern coast of California.
The flightless cormorant of the Galápagos Islands also seems to belong here.
They occur in marine and freshwater habitats.
Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically more similar to the ''P.
Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large seabirds.
''Limicorallus'', meanwhile, was initially believed to be a rail or a dabbling duck by some.
Almost all have some amount of white on the upperwing coverts, frontal crests, and blue eye-rings.
It contains the king and imperial complexes and the Guanay cormorant.
The eggs are a chalky-blue colour.
What seems sure is that this species must be placed in a distinct monotypic genus ''Poikilocarbo'' in almost any case, if any species are split from ''Phalacrocorax'' at all.

* ''Phalacrocorax'' sp.
In some Scandinavian areas, they are considered good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants.
What can be said with near certainty is that AMNH FR 25272 is from a diving bird that used its feet for underwater locomotion; as this is liable to result in some degree of convergent evolution and the bone is missing indisputable neornithine features, it is not entirely certain that the bone is correctly referred to this group.
The majority of species have dark feathers.
The resolution provided by the mtDNA 12S rRNA and ATPase subunits six and eight sequence data is not sufficient to properly resolve several groups to satisfaction; in addition, many species remain unsampled, the fossil record has not been integrated in the data, and the effects of hybridisation – known in some Pacific species especially – on the DNA sequence data are unstudied.
