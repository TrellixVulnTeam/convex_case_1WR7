Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic switching devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility substation.
This is just as when water flow moves the rubber membrane, it increases the amount of water on one side of the membrane, and decreases the amount of water on the other side.
Current reversal occurs when the current changes direction.
Because the conductors (or plates) are close together, the opposite charges on the conductors attract one another due to their electric fields, allowing the capacitor to store more charge for a given voltage than if the conductors were separated, giving the capacitor a large capacitance.

Capacitor-run induction motors have a permanently connected phase-shifting capacitor in series with a second winding.
As the capacitor reaches equilibrium with the source voltage, the voltages across the resistor and the current through the entire circuit decay exponentially.
As frequency approaches infinity, the capacitive impedance (or reactance) approaches zero and the ESR becomes significant.
If the conductors are separated by a material with a small conductivity rather than a perfect dielectric, then a small leakage current flows directly between them.
In ceramic capacitors, this is caused by degradation of the dielectric.
Alternatively, the time response of the capacitance can be used directly, as in ''deep-level transient spectroscopy''.
In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage.

Capacitors used in these applications may be built into a printed circuit board, between the various layers.
If XC approaches 0, the capacitor resembles a short wire that strongly passes current at high frequencies.
The equivalent series resistance (ESR) is the amount of internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.
A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge over a period of several minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.
For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts.

This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits.
Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass.
In the case of a fluctuating voltage ''V''(''t''), the stored energy also fluctuates and hence power must flow into or out of the capacitor.
Capacitors are connected in parallel with the power circuits of most electronic devices and larger systems (such as factories) to shunt away and conceal current fluctuations from the primary power source to provide a "clean" power supply for signal or control circuits.
The total voltage difference from end to end is apportioned to each capacitor according to the inverse of its capacitance.

Breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.
Several other types of capacitor are available for specialist applications.
To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.
For high-energy storage with capacitors in series, some safety considerations must be applied to ensure one capacitor failing and leaking current will not apply too much voltage to the other series capacitors.
(This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.)

More compact construction methods began to be used, such as a flexible dielectric sheet (like oiled paper) sandwiched between sheets of metal foil, rolled or folded into a small package.
The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field.
The capacitance, being proportional to the dielectric constant, also exhibits this frequency behavior.
The following year, the Dutch physicist Pieter van Musschenbroek invented a similar capacitor, which was named the Leyden jar, after the University of Leiden where he worked.
Another example of frequency dependent capacitance occurs with MOS capacitors, where the slow generation of minority carriers means that at high frequencies the capacitance measures only the majority carrier response, while at low frequencies both types of carrier respond.
