For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable.
#They would prefer a work environment in which they are able to assume responsibility for solving problems.
Research also suggests that that formal Westernized schooling can actually reshape the traditionally collaborative nature of social life in indigenous communities This research is supported cross-culturally, with variations in motivation and learning often reported higher between indigenous groups and their national Westernized counterparts than between indigenous groups across international continental divides.
Abraham Maslow believed that man is inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential.
They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain.
These drugs work in various ways to affect neurotransmitters in the brain.
# Consummation - decreases a tendency as it is performed.
Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual.
For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn to work in the fields and family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family.
By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers’, which serves as an example of their instilled sense of responsibility for their community.
A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced.
Today, these concepts are less likely to be used as distinct categories, but instead as two ideal types that define a continuum:
In incentive theory, stimuli "attract", a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus.
A person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people.
These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study.
In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment).
Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action.
For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment).
Motivation is a powerful tool in the work environment that can lead to employees working at their most efficient levels of production.
This theory focuses on the degree to which an individual’s behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined.
It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs.
For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.
This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads to an increase in their eagerness to participate and belong.
Rewards can be tangible or intangible, and is presented generally after the occurrence of the action or behavior that one is trying to correct or cause to happen again.
* Motivated employees are more quality oriented.
In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively.
As time passes the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating).
The Goal-Setting Theory states the importance of setting a goal or which direction to aim for that goal in motivating an individual.
Achievement motivation is an integrative perspective based on the premise that performance motivation results from the way broad components of personality are directed towards performance.
Incentive theory in psychology treats motivation and behavior of the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities that are expected to be profitable.
After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information.
Elton Mayo found that the social contacts a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation.
For instance when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger.
In this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior:
Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity.
Personality is intimately tied to performance and achievement motivation, including such characteristics as tolerance for risk, fear of failure, and others.
You have to carefully manage an organization so that, over time, innovations will emerge."
The field of behavioural economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.
Children are also trusted to be active contributors.
Introduced in a 2006 ''Academy of Management Review'' article, it synthesizes into a single formulation the primary aspects of several other major motivational theories, including Incentive Theory, Drive Theory, Need Theory, Self-Efficacy and Goal Setting.
Behavior is punished or reinforced in the context of whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might not be affected in every context, just because it was punished or reinforced in a particular one.
Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.
The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships.
Such efforts often focus on the subject rather than rewards or punishments.
In relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations.
Motivation can be divided into two different theories known as Intrinsic (internal) motivation and Extrinsic (external) motivation.
# Extrinsic motivation comes into play when a student is compelled to do something or act a certain way because of factors external to him or her (like money or good grades).
For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished a week after the troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.
* attribute their educational results to factors under their own control, also known as autonomy or locus of control
Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try.
This theory posits that there are three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory.
In the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action.
Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s.
Also, in some indigenous communities, young children can often portray a sense of community-based motivation through their parent-like interactions with siblings.
Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying.
Studies show that if the person receives the reward immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens.
The 16 basic desires that motivate our actions and define our personalities are:
Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.
* Linking rewards to performance
Starting from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Professor Steven Reiss has proposed a theory that found 16 basic desires that guide nearly all human behavior.
There are many different approaches of ''motivation training'', but many of these are considered pseudoscientific by critics.
Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development.
The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do.
* Safety/Security/Shelter/Health
* Motivated employees always look for better ways to do a job.
Motivation comes from two sources: oneself, and other people.
Classically, these categories are regarded as distinct.
In keeping with this view, his consulting firm, McBer & Company, had as its first motto "To make everyone productive, happy, and free."
The transition from childhood to adolescence can be seen in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time.
Cognitive theory defines motivation in terms of how an individual reacts to different situations by examining and the process of thoughts to respond instead of an inner built set of instructions to react to different situations.
This transition between childhood and adolescence increases motivation because children gain social responsibility within their families.
When these needs are satisfied, there are positive consequences, such as well-being and growth, leading people to be motivated, productive and happy.
For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation).
That is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation.
Drive theory grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst.
Content theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates us (needs).
These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification.
Observation techniques and integration methods are demonstrated in such examples as weaving in Chiapas, Mexico, where it is commonplace for children to learn from "a more skilled other" within the community.
Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.
The lower level needs such as Physiological and Safety needs will have to be satisfied before higher level needs are to be addressed.
In ''Essentials of Organizational Behavior'', Robbins and Judge examine recognition programs as motivators, and identify five principles that contribute to the success of an employee incentive program:
Attribution theory is a theory developed by psychologist, Fritz Heider that describes the processes by which individuals explain the causes of their behavior and events.
There have been various studies on the connection between motivation and games.
If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money.
They enjoy the reward of playing.
The interpersonal perspective includes beliefs about the responsibility of others and other directed affects of emotions; the individual would place the blame on another individual.
A student who blames their test failure on the teacher would be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling of disappointment as motivation to rely on a different study source other than the teacher for the next test.
Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.
AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students’ ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised.
McGregor places money in his Theory X category and feels it is a poor motivator.
The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company’s strategic objectives in a measurable way.
The various mechanisms of operant conditioning may be used to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).
Children are incorporated and welcomed to participate in daily activities and thus feel motivated to participate due to them seeking a sense of belonging in their families and communities.
For many indigenous students (such as Native American children), motivation may be derived from social organization; an important factor educators should account for in addition to variations in Sociolinguistics and Cognition.
* Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and mastering their inner forces (such as drive and emotions).
The Cognitive Theory of motivation are derived from two basic theories which are the Goal-Setting Theory and the Expectancy Theory.
Content theory of human motivation includes both Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Motivating operations are factors that affect learned behavior in a certain context.
Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.
Children’s learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community.
According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation.
Employee recognition is not only about gifts and points.
The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas.
The content theory was one of the earliest theories of motivation.
The child's real responsibility within the Mayan community can be seen in, for example, weaving apprenticeships; often, when the "more skilled other" is tasked with multiple obligations, an older child will step in and guide the learner.
The needs hierarchy system, devised by Maslow (1954), is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.
* Self-esteem/Recognition/Achievement
With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly.
In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier.
'''Advantages''': Intrinsic motivation can be long-lasting and self-sustaining.
Mayo believed that workers could be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making them feel important.
"The vast majority of companies want to be innovative, coming up with new products, business models and better ways of doing things.
In essence, scientific management bases human motivation wholly on extrinsic rewards and discards the idea of intrinsic rewards.
It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire.
'''Disadvantages''': Efforts at fostering intrinsic motivation can be slow to affect behavior and can require special and lengthy preparation.
A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior.
The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.
The assumptions of Maslow and Herzberg were challenged by a classic study at Vauxhall Motors' UK manufacturing plant.
However, recent research (on Satisficing for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favour of a more bounded rationality.
Motivational models are central to game design, because without motivation, a player will not be interested in progressing further within a game.
Jon Radoff has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement.
Jobs high in motivating potential must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback, and also must be high on at least one of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness.
'''Motivation''' is a theoretical construct used to explain behavior.
* Needs are arranged in order of importance to human life, from the basic to the complex.
Efforts to build this kind of motivation are also typically efforts at promoting student learning.
There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.
The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual.
Alderfer, expanding on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, created the ''ERG theory''.
Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it.
Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.
There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.
This requires getting to know one’s students.
An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close.
Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior.
However, innovation is not so easy to achieve.
The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior.
It is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in social psychology.
His model has been judged as placing undue reliance on social contacts within work situations for motivating employees.
In classical (or respondent) conditioning, behavior is understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli.
Praise and recognition are placed in the Theory Y category and are considered stronger motivators than money.
For McClelland, satisfaction lay in aligning a person's life with their fundamental motivations.
In contrast, avoidance motivation can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a negative/undesirable outcome.
* Physiology (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.)
Both processes require self-regulatory efforts.
Also, in some Indigenous communities in the Americas, motivation is a driving force for learning.
For example, using the intrapersonal perspective, a student who failed a test may attribute their failure for not studying enough and would use their emotion of shame or embarrassment as motivation to study harder for the next test.
Their active participation allows them to learn and gain skills that are valuable and useful in their communities.
One thing that is mentioned is "Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider."
By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing.
Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they:
Created by Clark Hull  and further developed by Kenneth Spence, the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s.
Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions.
Motivation can be conceived of as a cycle in which thoughts influence behaviors, behaviors drive performance, performance affects thoughts, and the cycle begins again.
This introduced the concept of orientation to work and distinguished three main orientations: instrumental (where work is a means to an end), bureaucratic (where work is a source of status, security and immediate reward) and solidaristic (which prioritizes group loyalty).
According to Maehr and Meyer, "Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are."
Suggested by Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions.
For example, if a manager is trying to motivate his employees by satisfying their needs; according to Maslow, he should try to satisfy the lower level needs before he tries to satisfy the upper level needs or the employees will not be motivated.
Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities.
Children from Navajo communities were shown to have higher levels of social concern than Anglo American children in their schools.
Herzberg's theory has found application in such occupational fields as information systems and in studies of user satisfaction such as computer user satisfaction.
In one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition.
#They want to hear continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.
Vroom's "expectancy theory" provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.
Research done by Whyte in 1986 raised the awareness of counselors and educators in this regard.
Only unsatisfied needs influence behavior, satisfied needs do not.
Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.
Instead, whatever behavior the student was performing just prior to the punishment would instead decrease.
Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity that they are doing within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.
As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body.
One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure.
In addition to these basic principles, antecedent factors also affect behavior.
A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.
Maslow has money at the lowest level of the hierarchy and shows other needs are better motivators to staff.
Students are individuals, so a variety of approaches may be needed to motivate different students.
In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored.
It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for consideration.
In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.
Students tending toward a more internal locus of control are more academically successful, thus encouraging curriculum and activity development with consideration of motivation theories.
Motivation lies at the core of many behaviorist approaches to psychological treatment.
There are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to McClelland’s research.
Sibling guidance is supported from early youth, where learning through play encourages horizontally-structured environments through alternative educational models such as "Intent Community Participation."
Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.
Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations.
It can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force.
When individuals seek positive feedback from their failures, they use the feedback as motivation to show improved performances.
In one study, when children were given mild threats against playing with an attractive toy, it was found that the threat actually served to increase the child's interest in the toy, which was previously undesirable to the child in the absence of threat.
This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra.
Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to overjustification and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation.
The American motivation psychologist Abraham H. Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs consisting of five hierarchic classes.
In operant conditioning, the type and frequency of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences.
Its American segment retains formality and authority amongst members and the organization.
Goal-setting theory is based on the notion that individuals sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state.
* The further the progress up the hierarchy, the more individuality, humanness and psychological health a person will show.
#They would take calculated risk and establish moderate, attainable goals.
The ideal that human beings are rational and human behavior is guided by reason is an old one.
The JCM links the core job dimensions listed above to critical psychological states which results in desired personal and work outcomes.
As a result, employees were given freedom to make decisions on the job and greater attention was paid to informal work groups.
Also he has to remember that not everyone will be satisfied by the same needs.
Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.
The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action.
