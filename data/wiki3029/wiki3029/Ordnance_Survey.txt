When Colby retired he recommended William Yolland as his successor, but he was considered too young and a less experienced Lewis Alexander Hall was appointed.
; Integrated transport network : A link-and-node network of transport features such as roads and railways.
The accompanying software is GPS-aware, and the maps are ready-calibrated.
They have orange covers, and contain 403 sheets covering the whole of Great Britain (the Isle of Man is excluded from this series).
After 1854, the six-inch maps and their revisions were based on the "twenty-five inch" maps and theirs.
From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or "second revision") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three times.
A start was made on mapping the whole country, county by county, at six inches to the mile (1:10,560).
In response, King George II charged Watson with making a military survey of the Highlands under the command of the Duke of Cumberland.
Ordnance Survey's flagship digital product, launched in November 2001, is ''OS MasterMap'', a database that records, in one continuous digital map, every fixed feature of Great Britain larger than a few metres.
Place names were recorded in "Name Books", a system first used in Ireland.
Until 1969, Ordnance Survey largely remained at its Southampton city centre HQ and at temporary buildings in the suburb of Maybush nearby, when a new purpose-built headquarters was opened in Maybush adjacent to the wartime temporary buildings there.
All Ordnance Survey Ireland maps (historic and current) are available free to view on their online website.
The metric national grid reference system was launched and 1:25000-scale series of maps was introduced.
; ''OS Landplan'' : a raster map at 1:10 000 scale.
By the end of 2010, when the scheme closed, over 6 million maps had been given away.
Two scales are offered1:50,000 (equivalent to 40&nbsp;km by 40&nbsp;km) or 1:25,000 (20&nbsp;km by 20&nbsp;km)and the maps may be produced either folded or flat for framing or wall mounting.
Some of the remaining buildings of the original Southampton city-centre site are now used as part of the city's court complex.
Custom scales may also be produced from the enlargement or reduction of the existing scales.
Following a fire at its headquarters at the Tower of London in 1841 the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in Southampton and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use.
; ''Road''  : A series of eight sheets covering Great Britain, designed for road users.
The scheme was replaced by free access to the  Digimap for Schools service provided by EDINA for eligible schools.
The Survey's large-scale mapping comprises maps at six inches to the mile or more (1:10,560, superseded by 1:10,000 in the 1950s) and was available as sheets until the 1980s, when it was digitised.
Work was begun in earnest in 1790 under Roy's supervision, when the Board of Ordnance (a predecessor of part of the modern Ministry of Defence) began a national military survey starting with the south coast of England.
Ordnance Survey maps remain in copyright for fifty years after their  publication.
In 1824, Colby and most of his staff moved to Ireland to work on a six-inches-to-the-mile (1:10,560) valuation survey.
Part of the latter was converted into a new conference centre in 2000, which was used for both internal events and made available for external organisations to hire.
During the next twenty years, roughly a third of England and Wales was mapped at the same scale (see Principal Triangulation of Great Britain) under the direction of William Mudge, as other military matters took precedence.
As of 2005, ''OS MasterMap'' was at version 6; 2010's version 8 includes provision for Urban Paths (an extension of the "integrated transport network" layer) and pre-build address layer.
Colby was not only involved in the design of specialist measuring equipment.
Ordnance Survey has been subject to criticism.
On 1 April 2010, Ordnance Survey released the brand '' OS OpenData'' under an attribution-only license compatible with CC-by.
In mid-2013, Ordnance Survey described an "enhanced" linked-data service with a SPARQL 1.1-compliant endpoint and bulk-download options.
The primary triangulation of the United Kingdom of Roy, Mudge and Yolland was completed by 1841, but was greatly improved by Alexander Ross Clarke who completed a new survey based on Airy's spheroid in 1858, completing the Principal Triangulation.

The complex is notable for its concrete mural by sculptor Keith McCarter and the concrete elliptical paraboloid shell roof over the staff restaurant building.
The four maps packs currently published are ''Off-Road Cycling Hampshire'' North, South, East and West.
From 1911 onwardsand mainly between 1911 and 1913the Ordnance Survey photo-enlarged many 1:2500 sheets covering built-up areas to 1:1250 (50.688&nbsp;inches to the mile) for Land Valuation and Inland Revenue purposes.
For the second survey, in 1934, this process was used again and resulted in the building of many triangulation pillars (trig points): short (approx.
The digitisation of the data has allowed Ordnance Survey to sell maps electronically.
Organisations using Ordnance Survey data have to purchase a licence to do so.
In later editions the six-inch sheets were published in "quarters" (NW,NE,SW,SE), each covering an area of three by two miles on the ground.
It governs the design of a map and it is the cartography that ensures the intended message is delivered both efficiently and aesthetically.
The name of each place is to be inserted as it is commonly spelt, in the first column of the name book and the various modes of spelling it used in books, writings &c. are to be inserted in the second column, with the authority placed in the third column opposite to each.''"
Each map pack contains 12 cycle routes printed on individual map sheets on waterproof paper.
Just under 400 towns with a population of over 4000 were surveyed at one of these three scales, most at 1:500.
The first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s.
The British Geological Survey was founded in 1835 as the Ordnance Geological Survey, under Henry De la Beche and remained a branch of the Ordnance Survey until 1965.
By 1810, one inch to the mile maps of most of the south of England were completed, but were withdrawn from sale between 1811 and 1816 because of security fears.
The Ordnance Survey Board remain accountable to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
These are still available in traditional sheet form.
Although there was a small computer section at Ordnance Survey in the 1960s, the digitising programme had replaced the need for printing large-scale maps, while computer-to-plate technology (in the form of a single machine) had also rendered the photographic platemaking areas obsolete.
The ''OL'' branded sheets within the Explorer series show areas of greater interest in England and Wales (such as the Lake District, the Black Mountains, etc.)
From the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many "restricted" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for War Office purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps.

Typically, each TOID is associated with a polygon that represents the area on the ground that the feature covers, in National Grid coordinates.
These, along with fifteen ''Tour'' maps, were discontinued during January 2010 as part of a drive for cost-efficiency.
Ordnance Survey had outgrown its site in the centre of Southampton (made worse by the bomb damage of the Second World War).
The buyer typically has the right to view the maps on a PC, a laptop and a pocket PC/smartphone, and to print off any number of copies.
This can be contrasted with, for example, the approach in the Republic of Ireland in more recent times, where Ordnance Survey Ireland claims regular copyright over its mapping (and over digital copies of the public domain historical mapping).
Ordnance Survey still maintains a set of master geodetic reference points to tie the Ordnance Survey geographic datum points to modern measurement systems such as GPS.
In 1747, Lieutenant-colonel David Watson proposed the compilation of a map of the Highlands to facilitate the subjugation of clans.
; Address 2 : Adds further information to the Address layer, such as addresses with multiple occupants (blocks of flats, student houses, etc.)
Major-General Sir Henry James was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily.
The following year, he completed an initial levelling of the country.
The map shows all footpaths and the format is similar to that of ''Explorer'' maps, albeit with less detail.
Modern Ordnance Survey maps are largely based on aerial photographs, but large numbers of the pillars remain, many of them adopted by private land owners.
Until 2010, OS also produced the following:
Thus, the user can quickly transfer a desired area from their PC to their laptop or smartphone, and go for a drive or walk with their position continually pinpointed on the screen.
This work was the starting point of the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself.
Currently (March 2011), OS claims 450 million TOIDs.
By the late 1990s, the need for vast areas for storing maps and for making printing plates by hand had been made obsolete by technological developments.
From 1850–53, twenty-nine towns were mapped at 1:528 (10 feet to the mile).
In 1985, the Committee of Enquiry into the Handling of Geographic Information was set up to "advise the Secretary of State for the Environment within two years on the future handling of geographic information in the UK, taking account of modern developments in information technology and market needs".
Every real-world object is assigned a unique reference number (TOID) that allows customers to add this reference to their own databases.

The maps have sky-blue covers and there are eight sheets in the series.
In an attempt to reduce the number of HGVs using unsuitable roads, a data-capture programme of "Road Routing Information" was recently undertaken, aiming to add information such as height restrictions and one-way streets.
This meant that it is supposed to be entirely self-funded from the commercial sale of its data and derived products whilst at the same time the public supplier of geographical information.
There was also a more general and nationwide need in light of the potential threat of invasion during the Napoleonic Wars.
The Kent map was published privately and stopped at the county border while the Essex maps were published by Ordnance Survey and ignore the county border, setting the trend for future Ordnance Survey maps.
In May 2015 Ordnance Survey announced that the new release of OL series maps would come with a mobile download version, available through a dedicated app on Android and iOS devices.
Above the industrial areas are extensive office areas.
Ordnance Survey still has a team of surveyors across Great Britain who visit in person and survey areas that cannot be surveyed using photogrammetric methods (such as land obscured by vegetation) and there is an aim of ensuring that any major feature (such as a new motorway or large housing development) is surveyed within six months of its construction.
Ordnance Survey is encouraging users of its old ''OS Land-Line'' data, a first-generation product consisting of tiles of map data, to migrate to ''OS MasterMap''.
Various groups and individuals had campaigned for this release of data, but some were disappointed when some of the profitable datasets, including the leisure 1:50,000 scale and 1:25,000 scale mapping, as well as the low scale Mastermap were not included.
This data is at the heart of many satnav systems.
''OS MasterMap'' consists of several so-called "layers" (see below) such as the aerial imagery, transport and postcode.
This granted a right to enter property for the purpose of the survey.
The consumer mapping can also be found on products created by licensed companies, with items as disparate as wallpaper, deckchairs and mugs all appearing with extracts of OS maps.
Eventually in 1870 it was transferred to the Office of Works.
The instructions for their use were: "''The persons employed on the survey are to endeavour to obtain the correct orthography of the names of places by diligently consulting the best authorities within their reach.
In 1801, the first one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360 scale) map was published, detailing the county of Kent, with Essex following shortly after.
Small-scale mapping comprises maps at less than six inches to the mile, such as the popular one inch to the mile "leisure" maps and their metric successors.
Hall was enthusiastic about extending the survey of the north of England to a scale of 1:2,500.
Similarly, the spelling of Scafell and Scafell Pike copied an error on an earlier map, and was retained as this was the name of a corner of one of the Principal Triangles, despite "Scawfell" being the almost universal form at the time.
Colby believed in leading from the front, travelling with his men, helping to build camps and, as each survey session drew to a close, arranging mountain-top parties with enormous plum puddings.

Very few other towns and cities saw a second edition of the town plans.
In 2007 Ordnance Survey were criticised for contracting the public relations company Mandate Communications to understand the dynamics of the free data movement and discover which politicians and advisers continue to support their current policies.
Their precise locations were determined by triangulation, and the details in between were then filled in with less precise methods.
Meanwhile, funding had been agreed in the 1850s for a more detailed survey of towns and cities.
''Tour'' maps are generally produced from enlargements of 1:250,000 mapping.

In 1935, the Davidson Committee was established to review Ordnance Survey's future.
Official procrastination followed, but the development of the railways added to pressure that resulted in the Ordnance Survey Act 1841.
they appear identical to the ordinary ''Explorer'', except the numbering and a little yellow mark on the corner (a relic of the old ''Outdoor Leisure'' series).
Ordnance Survey also produces more detailed custom mapping to order, at 1:10,000 (''Landplan'') and at 1:1,250 or 1:500 (''Siteplan''), from its large-scale digital data.
The one-inch maps continued to be produced until the 1970s, when they were superseded by the 1:50000-scale seriesas proposed by William Roy more than two centuries earlier.
While original survey methods were largely manual, the current surveying task is simplified by the use of GPS technology, allowing the most precise surveying standards yet.
The London first edition was completed and published in 326 sheets in the 1860s–70s; a second edition of 759 sheets was completed and brought out in the early 1890s; further revisions (incomplete coverage of London) followed between 1906 and 1937.
Ordnance Survey is responsible for a UK-wide network of GPS stations known as "OS Net".

The de-classified sheets have now been deposited in some of the Copyright Libraries, helping to complete the map-picture of pre-Second World War Britain.
Ordnance Survey produces a large variety of paper maps and digital mapping products.
These were withheld with the counter-argument that if licensees do not pay for OS data collection then the government would have to be willing to foot a £30million bill per annum to obtain the future economic benefit of sharing the mapping.
Ordnance Survey produces a wide variety of different products aimed at business users, such as utility companies and local authorities.
This had led to a demand for similar treatment in England and work was proceeding on extending the six-inch map to northern England, but only a three-inch scale for most of Scotland.
