Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer's human effects and they emphasize both the state of the patient's health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself, rather than to delay, to ignore, or to rely entirely on others.
These tests may provide information about molecular changes (such as mutations, fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes) and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment.
* A further mutation may cause loss of a tumor suppressor gene, disrupting the apoptosis signalling pathway and immortalizing the cell.
In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.

Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.
Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk.
For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits.

Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted.
Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions and insertions, which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product.
The transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth.

Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome), which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer, among others.
Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location.
For example, cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called ''hepatocarcinoma'', while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a ''liposarcoma''.
Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.
The most common types of cancer differ, but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans.
Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes.

Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome.
Other factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.
Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease.
