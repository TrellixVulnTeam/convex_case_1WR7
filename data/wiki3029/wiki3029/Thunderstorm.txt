:* Get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives.
Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September.
The loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound.
Most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day.
*Ground to cloud lightning is when a lightning bolt is induced from the ground to the cloud.
Cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations.
This is the most common type of thunderstorm development.
The lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth.
Often this 'cap' is the tropopause.
:* Monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area.
Any thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.
The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary.
In areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning, like Florida, lightning causes several fatalities per year, most commonly to people working outside.
The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused.
Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line.
Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall.
Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are basic.
Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface.
Downburst winds are generally very powerful, and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic.
They form at high latitudes during the cold season.
Cheyenne, Wyoming is North America's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season.
Thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe, and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones.
More intense systems form over land than over water.
Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Venus.
Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30&nbsp;minutes.
Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term "cell" refers to each separate principal updraft.
These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the Earth.
Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive.
As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell.
*Clear-air lightning is used widely to describe lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it.
Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit.
If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated.
Clouds form as relatively warmer air, carrying moisture, rises within cooler air.
Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it.
Distilled water, which contains no carbon dioxide, has a neutral pH of 7.
The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation.
*Cloud to ground lightning is when a bolt of lightning from a cloud strikes the ground.
Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography.
Supercell storms are large, usually severe, quasi-steady-state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height ("wind shear"), and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts (i.e., where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft) with a strong, rotating updraft (a "mesocyclone").
Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere ("wind shear").
Most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning.
The NWS stopped recommending the "lightning crouch" in 2008 as it doesn't provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike.
One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India.
Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly.
TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning.
As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air.
While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.
In the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther.
Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form:
Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP, where mesoscale low pressure areas are present.
:* Be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm.
These storms can produce destructive tornadoes, sometimes F3 or higher, extremely large hailstones ( diameter), straight-line winds in excess of , and flash floods.
Martin Luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began, causing him to pray to God for being saved and promising to become a monk.
Waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes, characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds.
It is seen in the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball.
In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules.
It can be seen in the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky.
Hail is one of Canada's most costly hazards.
Flash flooding is the process where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods.
Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth.
Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall.
Once the parent MCS dies, later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex (MCV).
*Heat Lightning refers to a lightning flash that is seen from the horizon that does not have accompanying thunder.
Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.
Hail can cause serious damage, notably to automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass-roofed structures, livestock, and most commonly, farmers' crops.
Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom (this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon).
During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere.
# A lifting force (heat)
The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles.
These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.
Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a front.
The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir.
Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.
A mesoscale convective system (MCS) is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones, and normally persists for several hours or more.
Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion.
China also experiences significant hailstorms.
In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.
:* Know the names of local counties, cities, and towns, as these are how warnings are described.
These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm.
Wheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage.
A thin layer of water clouds appears to underlie the ammonia layer within Jupiter's atmosphere, where thunderstorms evidenced by flashes of lightning have been detected.
Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.
When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.
In the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft.
Thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration.
A '''thunderstorm''', also known as an '''electrical storm''', '''lightning storm''', or '''thundershower''', is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder.
When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud's ascension.
Because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang, although both occur at the same moment.
Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest  of the Earth's atmosphere.
Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings.
In fact, research has also shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of thunderstorm.
The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as ''cumulus'' clouds.
The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion.
The clouds of Venus are capable of producing lightning much like the clouds on Earth.
The first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage.
Every spring, storm chasers head to the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping.
The squall line contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts.
Supercells are the strongest type of thunderstorm, even stronger than the most severe thunderstorms.
As these fall, they melt to become rain.
Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain.
Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history.
Greeks believed that they were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus.
Precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels (pH), otherwise known as acid rain, is also a frequent risk produced by lightning.
One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.
The two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture.
A mesoscale convective system's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape, and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, lake-effect snow events, polar lows, and Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs), and they generally form near weather fronts.
:* Cancel or reschedule outdoor events (to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits).
Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector.
# An unstable airmass
The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.
Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term "air mass thunderstorm".
Also known as air-mass thunderstorms, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales.
The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation.
All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: the '''developing stage''', the '''mature stage''', and the '''dissipation stage'''.
Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds.
While severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer, they can occur at just about any time of the year.
Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California.
An '''EF0''' tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but not substantial structures.
One exception is that of lake-effect snow bands, which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water, and occurs from fall through spring.
A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.
Downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms.
Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast.
Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density.
They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure.
Some preparedness takes the form of general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year).
The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate.
:* Take action early so you have time to get to a safe place.
Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development.
The average thunderstorm has a  diameter.
Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.
Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather.
Hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards (known as orographic lifting), thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.
In temperate regions, they are most frequent in spring and summer, although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year.
The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.
Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged.
In more contemporary times, thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity.
They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all.
Lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm.
Other cities known for frequent storm activity include Darwin, Caracas, Manila and Mumbai.
In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding.
*Cloud to cloud lightning is rarely seen and is when a bolt of lightning arcs from one cloud to another.
*In-cloud lightning is the most common.
*Ball lightning is extremely rare and has several hypothesized explanations.
Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, even in the polar regions, with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas, where they may occur nearly daily.
There are four types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells.
Some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states.
Kampala and Tororo in Uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on Earth, a claim also made for Bogor on Java, Indonesia and Singapore.
Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation.
The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays.
More organized meteorological projects such as VORTEX2 use an array of sensors, such as the Doppler on Wheels, vehicles with mounted automated weather stations, weather balloons, and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather.
Forms of MCS that develop in the tropics are found in use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon troughs, generally within the warm season between spring and fall.
(Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge, so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning.)
Severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell.
:* Don't shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms.
Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon.
The air tends to rise in an ''updraft'' through the process of convection (hence the term convective precipitation).
Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.
When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm.
Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes.
Across Europe, Croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail.
There are several types of lightning:
:* If in a group, spread out so that you increase the chances for survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a lightning strike.
Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water.
A thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least , hail is  in diameter or larger, or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported.
Preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm.
These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes.
''Multicell storms'' form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines.
“Clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.
This term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft.
During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.
Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water.
This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm.
In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil, resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.
This form poses the greatest threat to life and property.
If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem.
On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.
These storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud (or anvil) can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere, and supercell storms can be  wide.
Polar lows are a second special class of MCS.
In Canada, a rainfall rate greater than  in one hour, or  in three hours, is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms.
European and Asian mountainous areas experience similar events.
*Dry lightning is a misnomer that refers to a thunderstorm whose precipitation does not reach the ground.
If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder.
The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior.
The largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the United States fell in 2003 in Aurora, Nebraska, United States.
The similar TORRO scale ranges from a '''T0''' for extremely weak tornadoes to '''T11''' for the most powerful known tornadoes.
Thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures.
Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash.
The National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur:
Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones.
Lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level.
Most tornadoes have wind speeds between , are approximately  across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.
Also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon (within  a strike can occur, and as the storm is so far away, the strike is referred to as ''clear-air''.
They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter.
Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.
This phenomenon is known as a downburst.
The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms.
In the U.S. and Canadian Rockies, a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable, (either visually or audibly), from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes.
While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating ''downdrafts'' as well.
As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over .
Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion.
