Roden uses the term "queer" in a very general sense "to include any dissonant behaviours, discourses or claimed identities" in relation to Victorian norms.
This resulted in his being dismissed from the post on 8 March 1830; and three months later Newman withdrew from the Bible Society, completing his move away from the Low Church group.
Wilfred Ward, Newman's first biographer, describes the Lectures as follows: "We have the very curious spectacle of a grave religious apologist giving rein for the first time at the age of fifty to a sense of rollicking fun and gifts of humorous writing, which if expended on other subjects would naturally have adorned the pages of Thackeray's Punch."
Newman saw this as his third providential illness.
Newman wrote after St John's death: "I have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husband's or a wife's, but I feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater, or any one's sorrow greater, than mine."
Just then, however, his study of monophysitism caused him to doubt whether Anglican theology was consistent with the principles of ecclesiastical authority which he had come to accept.
A "common antagonism to domesticity" links "Tractarian discipline to Carlylean heroism".
Newman assisted Whately in his popular work ''Elements of Logic'' (1826, initially for the ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana''), and from him gained a definite idea of the Christian Church as institution: "... a Divine appointment, and as a substantive body, independent of the State, and endowed with rights, prerogatives and powers of its own".
He cited diary entries from December 1816 in which the 15-year-old Newman wrote about the temptations awaiting him when he returned home from boarding school and met girls at Christmas parties.
Juan R. Vélez writes that someday Newman "may well earn a new title, that of ''Doctor amicitiae'': Doctor of the Church on Friendship.
All this makes it clear that Father Newman does not give enough attention to details.
The libel charge was officially laid against Newman in November.
A gifted amateur artist, she painted many portraits of Newman at various periods, as well as several of the pictures hanging in the Birmingham Oratory.
Since accepting his post at St. Mary's, Newman had a chapel (dedicated to Sts.
They provide pastoral services and ministries to Catholics at non-Catholic universities; at various times this type of "campus ministry" (the distinction and definition being flexible) has been known to Catholics as the Newman Apostolate or "Newman movement".
Emily Bowles, who first met Newman at Littlemore, was the recipient of some of his most outspoken letters on what he felt to be the mistaken course of the extreme infallibilists and his reasons for not "speaking out" as many begged him to do.
For men of their time and culture that statement is definitive.... Newman's burial with Ambrose St John cannot be detached from his understanding of the place of friendship in Christian belief or its long history."
This choice, he later commented, produced the Oxford Movement with all its consequences.
On 27 February 1891, Newman's estate was probated at £4,206.
He also read ''The Force of Truth'' by Thomas Scott.
Andrew Nash describes the Lectures as: "an analysis of this anti-Catholic ideology, satirising it, demonstrating the false traditions on which it was based and advising Catholics how they should respond to it.
Bray cites numerous examples of friends being buried together.
In the sermon, Newman said: "There have been men before now, who have supposed Christian love was so diffuse as not to admit of concentration upon individuals; so that we ought to love all men equally.... Now I shall maintain here, in opposition to such notions of Christian love, and with our Saviour's pattern before me, that the best preparation for loving the world at large, and loving it duly and wisely, is to cultivate our intimate friendship and affection towards those who are immediately about us."
His ''Dealings with the Inquisition'' was a best seller.
His father, John Newman, was a banker with Ramsbottom, Newman and Company in Lombard Street.
Kingsley, who interpreted the Biblical story of Adam and Eve as expressing a "binary law of man's being; the want of a complementum, a 'help meet', without whom it is not good for him to be", feared and hated vowed sexual abstinence, considering it, in Laura Fasick's words, "a distinct and separate perversion".
Contemporary sources show that the coffin was covered with a softer type of soil than the clay marl of the grave site.
He now considered the position of Anglicans to be similar to that of the semi-Arians in the Arian controversy.
Geoffrey Faber, whose own account of Newman in ''Oxford Apostles'' was far from hagiographic, found Strachey's portrait a distasteful caricature, bearing scant likeness to the Newman of history and designed solely "to tickle the self-conceit of a cynical and beliefless generation".
Natural religion refers to the knowledge of God and divine things that has been acquired outside the Judeo-Christian revelation.
Newman gave no sign of disapproval when the doctrine was finally defined, but was an advocate of the "principle of minimising", that included very few papal declarations within the scope of infallibility.
Ten days later he preached his first sermon in Holy Trinity at Over Worton, near Banbury, Oxfordshire when on a visit to his former teacher, the Reverend Walter Mayers, who had been curate there since 1823.
In the same year Newman was appointed vicar of St Mary's University Church, to which the benefice of Littlemore (to the south of the city of Oxford) was attached, and Pusey was made Regius Professor of Hebrew.
Theirs was a generation prepared to accept romantic friendships between men simply as friendships without sexual significance.
Defending his decision to remain single, Charles Reding, the hero of Newman's novel ''Loss and Gain'', argues that "surely the idea of an Apostle, unmarried, pure, in fast and nakedness, and at length a martyr, is a higher idea than that of one of the old Israelites sitting under his vine and fig-tree, full of temporal goods, and surrounded by sons and grandsons?"
On Catholics, his influence was mainly in the direction of a broader spirit and of a recognition of the part played by development, in doctrine and in church government.
When Newman died there appeared in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof.
In 1828 Newman supported and secured the election of Edward Hawkins as Provost of Oriel over John Keble.
John Cornwell comments that "the notion of Newman's effeminacy tells us more about the reaction of others to him at the time than about any tendency in his own nature."
# Assumed principles of the intellectual ground of the Protestant view
His parishioners at the Oratory, apart from a few professional men and their families, were mainly factory workers, Irish immigrants, and tradespeople.
Aged 14, he read sceptical works by Thomas Paine, David Hume and perhaps Voltaire.
The friendship of Alfred Tennyson and Arthur Hallam, immortalised in ''In Memoriam A.H.H.
On 11 August 1890 he died of pneumonia at the Birmingham Oratory.
# Ignorance concerning Catholics the protection of the Protestant view
On board the mail steamship ''Hermes'' they visited Gibraltar, Malta, the Ionian Islands and, subsequently, Sicily, Naples and Rome, where Newman made the acquaintance of Nicholas Wiseman.
Alan Bray, however, in his 2003 book ''The Friend'', saw the bond between the two men as "entirely spiritual", noting that Newman, when speaking of St John, echoes the language of John's gospel.
In contrast to Strachey's account, James Anthony Froude, Hurrell Froude's brother, who knew Newman at Oxford, saw him as a Carlylean hero.
Archdeacon Julius Hare said that Newman "is determined to say whatever he chooses, in despite of facts and reason".
The pall over the coffin bore the motto that Newman adopted for use as a cardinal, ''Cor ad cor loquitur'' ("Heart speaks to heart"), which William Barry, writing in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913), traces to Francis de Sales and sees as revealing the secret of Newman's "eloquence, unaffected, graceful, tender, and penetrating".
As an Anglican, Newman subscribed to this notion in various works, among them the 1830 University Sermon entitled "The Influence of Natural and Revealed Religion Respectively", the 1833 poem "Heathenism", and the book ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'', also 1833, where he admits that there was "something true and divinely revealed in every religion".
Tractarian writings had a wide and continuing circulation after 1845, well beyond the range of personal contacts with the main Oxford figures, and Tractarian clergy continued to be recruited into the Church of England in numbers.
In a September 2010 television documentary, "The Trouble with the Pope", Peter Tatchell discussed Newman's underlying sexuality, citing his close friendship with Ambrose St John and entries in Newman's diaries describing their intense love for each other.
Newman removed the libellous section of the fifth lecture and replaced them by the inscription:
For the Roman Catholic Church in Britain, Newman's conversion secured prestige.
It was thought that the creation of a Catholic body within the heart of Oxford was likely to induce Catholics to send their sons to that university, rather than to newly formed Catholic universities.
Originally an evangelical Oxford University academic and priest in the Church of England, Newman then became drawn to the high-church tradition of Anglicanism.
Though this was not altogether new, Archibald Campbell Tait, with three other senior tutors, denounced it as "suggesting and opening a way by which men might violate their solemn engagements to the university."
Newman's burial with St John was not unusual at the time and did not draw contemporary comment.
In 1835 Pusey joined the movement, which, so far as concerned ritual observances, was later called "Puseyite".
Edward Lowth Badeley, who had been a close legal adviser to Newman since the Achilli trial, encouraged him to make a robust rebuttal.
There George Huxley, father of Thomas Henry Huxley, taught mathematics, and the classics teacher was Walter Mayers.
George W. E. Russell recorded that:
Ian Ker has raised the profile of Newman's satire.
An interval of two years then elapsed before Newman was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 9 October 1845 by Dominic Barberi, an Italian Passionist, at the college in Littlemore.
At the close of 1847, Newman returned to England as an Oratorian and resided first at Maryvale (near Old Oscott); then at St Wilfrid's College, Cheadle; and then at St Anne's, Alcester Street, Birmingham.
Its tone changed the popular estimate of its author, by explaining the convictions which had led him into the Catholic Church.
After some preliminary sparring between the two, in which Kingsley refused to admit any fault, Newman published a pamphlet, ''Mr Kingsley and Dr Newman: a Correspondence on the Question whether Dr Newman teaches that Truth is no Virtue'', (published in 1864 and not reprinted until 1913).
Rose met Oxford Movement figures on a visit to Oxford looking for magazine contributors, and it was in his rectory house at Hadleigh, Suffolk, that a meeting of High Church clergy was held over 25–26 July (Newman was not present, but Hurrell Froude, Arthur Philip Perceval and William Palmer had gone to visit Rose), at which it was resolved to fight for "the apostolical succession and the integrity of the Prayer Book."
His prose style, especially in his Catholic days, is fresh and vigorous, and is attractive to many who do not sympathise with his conclusions, from the apparent candour with which difficulties are admitted and grappled; while in his private correspondence there is charm.
A review in ''The Rambler'', a Catholic periodical, saw them as "furnishing a key to the whole mystery of anti-Catholic hostility and as shewing the special point of attack upon which our controversial energies should be concentrated."
Despite the evidence of the victims and witnesses, Achilli denied that any of it had happened; the jury believed him and found Newman guilty of libel.
Newman's name was entered at Lincoln's Inn.
He was instrumental in the founding of the Catholic University of Ireland, which evolved into University College Dublin, today the largest university in Ireland.
Newman himself described the lectures as his "best written book."
In accordance with his express wishes, Newman was buried in the grave of his lifelong friend Ambrose St. John.
From the latter half of 1886, Newman's health began to fail, and he celebrated Mass for the last time on Christmas Day in 1889.
Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you.
Paz, anti-Catholicism was "an integral part of what it meant to be a Victorian".
I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was deprived of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors did their best to conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar.
The pamphlet has been described as "unsurpassed in the English language for the vigour of its satire".
This detailed examination of the Thirty-Nine Articles suggested that their framers directed their negations not against Catholicism's authorised creed, but only against popular errors and exaggerations.
The "sensitive recluse of legend" had a wide currency, appearing, for instance, in Lytton Strachey's description, in his famously debunking set of portraits ''Eminent Victorians,'' as Newman's  "soft, spectacled, Oxford manner, with its half-effeminate diffidence".
The personal consequences for Newman of his conversion were great: he suffered broken relationships with family and friends, attitudes to him within his Oxford circle becoming polarised.
He was quickly ordained as a priest and continued as an influential religious leader, based in Birmingham.
He supported John Capes in the committee he was organising for public lectures in February 1851.
His biography is a treatise on the human and supernatural virtues that make up friendship."
Some Newman disciples wrote about English saints, while Newman himself worked to complete an ''Essay'' on the development of doctrine.
Edward Bouverie Pusey was elected a fellow of the same college in 1823.
Coleridge later wrote to Keble:
A second trial was not granted and sentencing was postponed.
The Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, wrote a public letter to the Bishop of Durham and denounced this "attempt to impose a foreign yoke upon our minds and consciences".
Newman broke with Whately in 1827 on the occasion of the re-election of Robert Peel as Member of Parliament for the university: Newman opposed Peel on personal grounds.
On Newman's relations with Hurrell Froude, Faber wrote: "Of all his friends Froude filled the deepest place in his heart, and I'm not the first to point out that his occasional notions of marrying definitely ceased with the beginning of his real intimacy with Froude."
Anxiety to do well in the final schools produced the opposite result; he broke down in the examination, under Thomas Vowler Short, and so graduated as a BA with third-class honours in 1821.
However, the anger displayed was later, in a letter to Sir William Cope, admitted to have been largely feigned.
One of the most important was with Maria Giberne, who knew him in his youth and followed him into the Catholic Church.
Thus, Isaac Williams became Littlemore's curate instead, succeeded by John Rouse Bloxam from 1837 to 1840, during which the school opened.
In 1859, Newman established, in connection with the Birmingham Oratory, a school for the education of the sons of gentlemen along lines similar to those of English public schools.
Finally he settled at Edgbaston, where spacious premises were built for the community, and where (except for four years in Ireland) he lived a secluded life for nearly forty years.
On 13 June 1824, Newman was made an Anglican deacon in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.
In 1833, Newman wrote that, despite having "willingly" accepted the call to celibacy, he felt "not the less ... the need" of "the sort of interest sympathy which a wife takes and none but she – it is a woman's interest".
His mother, Jemima (née Fourdrinier), was descended from a notable family of Huguenot refugees in England, founded by the engraver, printer and stationer, Paul Fourdrinier.
# Duties of Catholics towards the Protestant view
Mayers, who had himself undergone a conversion in 1814, lent Newman books from the English Calvinist tradition.
David Hilliard characterises Geoffrey Faber's description of Newman, in his 1933 book ''Oxford Apostles'', as a "portrait of Newman as a sublimated homosexual (though the word itself was not used)".
After the debate went public, Kingsley attempted to defend his assertion in a lengthy pamphlet entitled ''"What then does Dr Newman mean?
I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, in the case of a person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four.
In the ''Apologia'' he had exorcised the phantom which, as he said, "gibbers instead of me" – the phantom of the secret Romanist, corrupting the youth of Oxford, devious and dissimulating.
The section of the lecture that was decided by jury to constitute a libel was:
This put Newman under great strain as he had been invited to be the founding Rector of the proposed Catholic University in Dublin and was composing and delivering the lectures that would become ''The Idea of a University''.
For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven.
He read Nicholas Wiseman's article in the ''Dublin Review'' on "The Anglican Claim", which quoted Augustine of Hippo against the Donatists, "''securus judicat orbis terrarum''" ("the verdict of the world is conclusive").
# Fable the basis of the Protestant view
One plan that surfaced was to set up a religious community in Littlemore, outside the city of Oxford.
In 1879, he was created a  cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in recognition of his services to the cause of the Catholic Church in England.
The teaching of the tracts was supplemented by Newman's Sunday afternoon sermons at St Mary's, the influence of which, especially over the junior members of the university, was increasingly marked during a period of eight years.
a great blow has been given to the administration of justice in this country, and Roman Catholics will have henceforth only too good reason for asserting that there is no justice for them in matters tending to rouse the Protestant feelings of judges and juries.
# True testimony insufficient for the Protestant view
Newman maintains that English Catholic priests are at least as truthful as English Catholic laymen.
Achilli, on hearing that witnesses were being brought, arranged for the trial to be delayed.
The effect on the wider Tractarian movement is still debated, since Newman's leading role is regarded by some scholars as overstated, as is Oxford's domination of the movement as a whole.
Newman had a special concern in the publisher Burns & Oates; the owner, James Burns, had published some of the Tractarians, and Burns had himself converted to Roman Catholicism in 1847.
James Joyce had a lifelong admiration for Newman's writing style, and in a letter to his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver humorously remarked about Newman that "nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church".
James Eli Adams remarks that if manliness is equated with physical and psychological toughness, then perhaps "manhood cannot be ''sustained'' within domesticity, since the ideal is incompatible with ease."
He became an evangelical Calvinist and held the typical belief that the Pope was the antichrist under the influence of the writings of Thomas Newton, as well as his reading of Joseph Milner's ''History of the Church of Christ''.
In 1858, Newman projected a branch house of the Oratory at Oxford; but this project was opposed by Father (later Cardinal) Henry Edward Manning, another influential convert from Anglicanism, and others.
The University ... has this object and this mission; it contemplates neither moral impression nor mechanical production; it professes to exercise the mind neither in art nor in duty; its function is intellectual culture; here it may leave its scholars, and it has done its work when it has done as much as this.
In 1831–1832 Newman became the "Select Preacher" before the University.
In a private letter to his bishop (William Bernard Ullathorne), surreptitiously published, he denounced the "insolent and aggressive faction" that had pushed the matter forward.
New Episcopal sees were created and Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman was to be the first Archbishop of Westminster.
Around 1830, Newman developed a distinction between natural religion and revealed religion.
Both as an Anglican and as a Catholic, he put forward the notion of a universal revelation.
Following the first edition, a number of paragraphs were removed following the Achilli trial as "they were decided by a jury to constitute a libel, June 24, 1852."
Newman's face was "remarkably like that of Julius Caesar....
Roden, however, does not argue that Newman was homosexual, seeing him rather – particularly in his professed celibacy – as a "cultural dissident" or "queer".
On 7 October, Wiseman announced the Pope's restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England in a pastoral letter ''From out of the Flaminian Gate'': Catholic England has been restored to its orbit in the ecclesiastical firmament, from which its light had long vanished, and begins anew its course of regularly adjusted action round the centre of unity, the source of jurisdiction, of light and vigour.
Newman published several books with the company, effectively saving it.
Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers.... For hundreds of young men ''Credo in Newmannum'' was the veritable symbol of faith."
The Oxford Oratory was eventually founded over 100 years later in 1993.
This was dubbed the "Papal Aggression".
However, in 1845 Newman, joined by some but not all of his followers, left the Church of England and his teaching post at Oxford University and was received into the Catholic Church.
The Protestant response was, predictably, less positive.
I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer.
The charge of effeminacy was aimed not just at Newman but at Tractarians and Roman Catholics in general.
On theological issues, Newman is seen as the more liberal because of his reservations about the declaration of papal infallibility (Manning favoured the formal declaration of the doctrine).
When John Campbell Shairp combines masculine and feminine imagery in his highly poetic description of Newman's preaching style at Oxford in the early 1840s, Frederick S. Roden is put in mind of "the late Victorian definition of a male invert, the homosexual: his (Newman's) homiletics suggest a woman's soul in a man's body."
Newman planned to appoint Charles Pourtales Golightly, an Oriel man, as curate at Littlemore in 1836.
At this date Newman became editor of the ''British Critic''.
It was during this time that he founded the Literary and Historical Society.
Strachey was only ten when Newman died and never met him.
His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant.
At the time of the First Vatican Council (1869–1870), Newman was uneasy about the formal definition of the doctrine of papal infallibility, believing that the time was 'inopportune'.
Catholics greeted them with enthusiasm.
She was a noted beauty, who even at fifty was described by one admirer as "the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life".
It was in the autumn of 1816 that Newman "fell under the influence of a definite creed", and received into his intellect "impressions of dogma, which, through God's mercy, have never been effaced or obscured".
Newman was also a literary figure of note: his major writings including the ''Tracts for the Times'' (1833–1841), his autobiography ''Apologia Pro Vita Sua'' (1865–66), the ''Grammar of Assent'' (1870), and the poem ''The Dream of Gerontius'' (1865), which was set to music in 1900 by Edward Elgar.
Newman's influence in Oxford was supreme about the year 1839.
When she visited Newman at the Birmingham Oratory in 1861, she was welcomed by him "as only he can welcome"; she would never forget "the brightness that lit up his worn face as he received me at the door, carrying in several packages himself".
He wrote the popular hymns "Lead, Kindly Light" and "Praise to the Holiest in the Height" (taken from ''Gerontius'').
And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome."
Newman requested the documents that Wiseman had used for his article in the ''Dublin Review'' but he had mislaid them.
Pius had mistrusted Newman, but his successor, Pope Leo XIII, was encouraged by the Duke of Norfolk and other English Catholic laymen to make Newman a cardinal, despite the fact that he was neither a bishop nor resident in Rome.
To many members of the Oxford Movement, Newman included, it was Kingsley's ideal of domesticity that seemed unmanly.
For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, it would have to be a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.
A recent biography of Newman notes that since his death in 1890 he has suffered almost as much misrepresentation as he did during his lifetime.
Newman's grave was opened on 2 October 2008, with the intention of moving any remains to a tomb inside Birmingham Oratory for their more convenient veneration as relics during Newman's consideration for sainthood; however, his wooden coffin was found to have disintegrated and no bones were found.
Newman's mother had laid the foundation stone in 1835, based on a half-acre plot and £100 given by Oriel College.
When Catholics did begin to attend Oxford from the 1860s onwards, a Catholic club was formed and, in 1888, it was renamed the Oxford University Newman Society in recognition of Newman's efforts on behalf of Catholicism in that university city.
Kingsley's general accusation against the Catholic clergy is dealt with later in the work; his specific accusations are addressed in an appendix.
In the words of Richard William Church, it was "Keble who inspired, Froude who gave the impetus and Newman who took up the work"; but the first organisation of it was due to Hugh James Rose, editor of the ''British Magazine'', who has been styled "the Cambridge originator of the Oxford Movement".
Additionally, colleges have been named for him in Birmingham, England, Melbourne, Australia, Thodupuzha, India, and Wichita, United States.
He directed that he be buried in the same grave as St. John: "I wish, with all my heart, to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave&nbsp;— and I give this as my last, my imperative will."
He was a great hater!
I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fifteen.
But he raised another phantom – that of the oversensitive, self-absorbed recluse who never did anything but think and write.
A few weeks later Newman started, apparently on his own initiative, the ''Tracts for the Times'', from which the movement was subsequently named "Tractarian".
In 1991, Newman was proclaimed venerable by Pope John Paul II, after a thorough examination of his life and work by the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints.
"In all that school", wrote Kingsley in 1851, "there is an element of foppery — even in dress and manner; a fastidious, maundering, die-away effeminacy, which is mistaken for purity and refinement."
Before the house at Edgbaston was occupied, Newman established the London Oratory, with Father Frederick William Faber as its superior.
To exponents of Muscular Christianity such as Charles Kingsley, celibacy was synonymous with unmanliness.
Led by ''The Times'' and ''Punch'', the British press saw this as being an attempt by the Papacy to claim jurisdiction over England.
In 1826 Newman returned as tutor of Oriel, and the same year Richard Hurrell Froude, described by Newman as "one of the acutest, cleverest and deepest men" he ever met, was elected fellow there.
The family lived in Southampton Street (now Southampton Place) in Bloomsbury and bought a country retreat in Ham, near Richmond, in the early 1800s.
Newman preached his last Anglican sermon at Littlemore, the valedictory "The parting of friends" on 25 September, and resigned the living of St Mary's, although he did not leave Littlemore for two more years, until his own formal reception into the Catholic Church.
However, his book did have a wide influence.
Richard Whately and Edward Copleston, Provost of Oriel, were leaders in the group of Oriel Noetics, a group of independently thinking dons with a strong belief in free debate.
He had been "rescued" from the Inquisition by a group of English ultra-Protestants as a hero six months before the Papal Aggression crisis broke.
Only with the emergence in the late nineteenth century of the doctrine of the stiff upper lip and the concept of homosexuality as an identifiable condition, did open expressions of love between men become suspect and regarded in a new light as morally undesirable."
In February 1843, Newman published, as an advertisement in the ''Oxford Conservative Journal'', an anonymous but otherwise formal retractation of all the hard things he had said against Roman Catholicism.
From Rome, instead of accompanying the Froudes home in April, Newman returned to Sicily alone.
Ker notes that Newman's imagery has a "savage, Swiftian flavour" and can be "grotesque in the Dickens manner".
Cardinal Manning seems not to have been interested in having Newman become a cardinal, and remained silent when the Pope asked him about it.
Newman published a revision of the series of pamphlets in book form in 1865; in 1913 a combined critical edition, edited by Wilfrid Ward, was published.
# Prejudice the life of the Protestant view
He was, however, sent shortly to Trinity College, Oxford, where he studied widely.
The response to the Lectures was split between Catholics and Protestants.
In spite of these similarities, in fact there was a lack of sympathy between the two men, who were different in character and experience, and they clashed on a number of issues, in particular the foundation of an Oratory in Oxford.
Although to the end of his life Newman looked back on his conversion to evangelical Christianity in 1816 as the saving of his soul, he gradually shifted away from his early Calvinism.
He said that extreme conditions which could remove bone would also have removed the coffin handles, which were extant.
