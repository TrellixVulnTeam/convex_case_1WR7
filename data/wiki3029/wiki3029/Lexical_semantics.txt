Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template.
Haspelmath refers to this as the anticausative alternation.
The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle.
This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.
This idea coincides with Chomsky's Projection Principle, because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).
There has been some debate as to whether the different classes of inchoative verbs are purely based in morphology, or whether the differentiation is derived from the lexical-semantic properties of each individual verb.
''Class A'' verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun '''', ''Class B'' verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and ''Class C'' verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun.
Haspelmath refers to this as the causative alternation.
The former are called free morphemes and the latter bound morphemes.
''Hans '''zerbrach''' die Vase.''
Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not marked with a reflexive pronoun, clitic, or affix), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked.
This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.
In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).
Syntactic basis of event structure: a brief history
''*I showed anyone nothing.''
In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen.
Morris Halle and Alec Marantz introduced the notion of distributed morphology in 1993.
''John '''broke''' the vase''.
Inchoative verbs are also known as anticausative verbs.
When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a).
Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.
Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning.
''*I showed herself Mary.''
Larson posited his Single Complement Hypothesis in which he stated that every complement is introduced with one verb.
The term ''generative'' was proposed by Noam Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures published in 1957.
To render these two different meanings, "again" attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.
In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.
I gave every worker his paycheck.
In English, WordNet is an example of a semantic network.
This can be seen in the following example: ''broke'' is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).
The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial.
Lexical items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single lexical units or from their surrounding environment.
''The vase '''broke'''.''
English change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives.
Causative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., Tagalog, Malagasy, Turkish, etc.
States that the formation of the complex word ''destruction'' is accounted for by a set of ''Lexical Rules,'' which are different and independent from syntactic rules.
The unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures.
''I showed no one anything.
In contrast, the verb ''öffnete'' is a ''Class A'' verb which necessarily takes the reflexive pronoun ''sich'' in its inchoative form, but remains unmarked in its causative form.
'John opened the door.'
''Who did you give which paycheck?
''Hans '''öffnete''' die Tür.''
Lexical units make up the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon.
The following is an example of the tree structure proposed by distributed morphology for the sentence ''"John's destroying the city"''.
The term ''generative linguistics'' was based on Chomsky's generative grammar, a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules (X' theory)  can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language.
(1a) defines the state of the door being closed; there is no opposition in this predicate.
Some languages (e.g., German, Italian, and French), have multiple morphological classes of inchoative verbs.
In her 2008 book, ''Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax'', linguist Gillian Ramchand acknowledges the roles of lexical entries in the selection of complex verbs and their arguments.
There are two types of change-of-state predicates: inchoative and causative.
The PP ''for Satoshi'' in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.
Ramchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement.
This is in keeping with X'Bar Theory of Phrase Structure Grammar, with Larson's tree structure using the empty Verb to which the V is raised.
''John sent Mary a package.''
Following are examples of Larson's tests to show that the hierarchical (superior) order of any two objects aligns with a linear order, so that the second is governed (c-commanded) by the first.
''John sent a package to Mary.''
''the door again''.
The words ''boil'', ''bake'', ''fry'', and ''roast'', for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of ''cooking''.
Based on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument.
Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes and the abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.
Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax.
According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is "when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head."
While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like ''German shepherd,'' would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g.
''corgi'', or ''poodle''), thus expanding the semantic field further.
Lexical items participate in regular patterns of association with each other.
'''''Nag'''tumba ng bata si Rosa.''
John opened the door
Larson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction "John sent Mary a package" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction "John sent a package to Mary".
The Double Object Construction presented in 1988 gave clear evidence of a hierarchical structure using asymmetrical binary branching.
A pronoun must have a quantifier as its antecedent:
Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.
In (4c) we see a transitive causative verb.
''*Which paycheck did you give who?''
A lexical entry lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself.
Inchoative verbs are intransitive, meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state.
This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field.
The analysis of these different lexical units had a decisive role in the field of "generative linguistics" during the 1960s.
'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching.
The study of lexical semantics looks at:
''The parcel is here.''
This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word ''red'' without knowing the meaning of ''scarlet,'' but understanding ''scarlet'' without knowing the meaning of ''red'' may be less likely.
Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree.
Some semantic relations between these synsets are meronymy, hyponymy, synonymy and antonymy.
Current theory recognizes the predicate in Specifier position of a tree in inchoative/anticausative verbs (intransitive), or causative verbs (transitive) is what selects the theta role conjoined with a particular verb.
For example, inchoative verbs in German are classified into three morphological classes.
This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis.
Lexical items contain information about category (lexical and syntactic), form and meaning.
By the early 1990s, Chomsky's minimalist framework on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages.
'John broke the vase.'
'''Lexical semantics''' (also known as lexicosemantics), is a subfield of linguistic semantics.
'''CAUS'''-fall of child DET Rosa
The effect of negative polarity means that "any" must have a negative quantifier as an antecedent:
First proposed by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain.
While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as Italian, French, and Greek, it has been suggested by linguist Florian Schäfer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in German.
The underlying structures are therefore not the same.
''Die Vase '''zerbrach'''.''
Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.
The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.
In (2a) the verb underlyingly takes a direct object, while in (2b) the verb underlyingly takes a subject.
Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English.
In ditransitive verbs such as ''give someone something'', ''send someone something'', ''show someone something'' etc.
The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked.
The following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb ''put'':
The subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below.
'Rosa knocked the child down.'
The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases.
This is referred to as syntax-semantic interface.
This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.
* unaccusative verb: __ VP V NP
The argument structure of ditransitive verb phrases is complex and has undergone different structural hypothesis.
Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.
The properties of lexical items include their category selection ''c-selection'', selectional properties ''s-selection'', (also known as semantic selection), phonological properties, and features.
Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words ''rose'' and ''rabbit'' without knowing what a ''marigold'' or a ''muskrat'' is.
''Destroy'' is the root, V-1 represents verbalization, and D represents nominalization.
In example (4a) we start with a stative intransitive adjective, and derive (4b) where we see an intransitive inchoative verb.
As seen in example in (9a) above, ''John sent Mary a package'', there is the underlying meaning that 'John "caused" Mary to have a package'.
However, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door.
The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word ''destroy'' to ''destruction'':
This can be seen in the following examples from Tagalog, where the causative prefix ''pag-'' (realized here as ''nag'') attaches to the verb ''tumba'' to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a).
English tends to favour labile alternations, meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms.
* the classification and decomposition of lexical items
Lexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax.
Hyponyms and hypernyms can be described by using a taxonomy, as seen in the example.
''I showed Mary herself.
In the mid 90's, linguists Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax.
the door opened '''REFL'''
(1b) and (1c) both have predicates showing transitions of the door going from being implicitly ''open'' to ''closed''.
They argue that a predicate's argument structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a lexical projection of its arguments.
* '''Generative Linguistics theory''': states the transformation of ''destroy'' → ''destruction'' as the nominal, ''nom'' + ''destroy,'' combined with phonological rules that produce the output ''destruction''.
Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an "''x unintentionally caused y''" reading).
We can see this in the following example:
The change-of-state property of Verb Phrases (VP) is a significant observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that the meaning of the entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure.
''put:'' V ''DP''agent'''' DP''experiencer''/PP''locative''
Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.
This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as ditransitive, inchoative, and causative verbs), could select their own specifier element within a syntax tree construction.
These tests with ditransitive verbs that confirm c-command also confirm the presence of underlying or invisible causative verbs.
This meaning can only occur if a head-projecting morpheme is present within the local domain of the syntactic structure.
Beck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same.
Some relations between lexical items include hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy and antonymy, as well as homonymy.
(2) '''Unaccusative'''
Knowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it.
''The knot is loose.''
The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson.
Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier "again".
Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy ''(big'' and ''large),'' antonymy ''(big'' and ''small),'' hypernymy and hyponymy ''(rose'' and ''flower),'' converseness ''(buy'' and ''sell),'' and incompatibility.
c. ''Sandy loosened the knot.''
(1b) gives the intransitive use of the verb close, with no explicit mention of the causer, but (1c) makes explicit mention of the agent involved in the action.
It contains English words that are grouped into synsets.
Question words follow this order:
Sentences with double objects occur with ditransitive verbs, as we can see in the following example:
This theory views the syntactic structure of words as a result of morphology and semantics, instead of the morpho-semantic interface being predicted by the syntax.
''Sally was so kind that she went out of her way to open the door''
* unergative verb: NP VP V
This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction.
''Thilo cooked Satoshi kisimen.
The original structural hypothesis was that of ternary branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne's 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.
(For example, the VP ''the vase broke'' carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.)
Lexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of morphology and not of syntax.
In example (5), the verb '''' is an unmarked inchoative verb from ''Class B'', which also remains unmarked in its causative form.
* the differences and similarities in lexical semantic structure cross-linguistically
As seen in the underlying tree structure for (3a), the silent subunit BECOME is embedded within the Verb Phrase (VP), resulting in the inchoative change-of-state meaning (y become z).
Reflexives and reciprocals (anaphors) show this relationship in which they must be c-commanded by their antecedents, such that the (10a) is grammatical but (10b) is not:
''Tumumba ang bata.''
In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb.
The semantics related to these categories then relate to each lexical item in the lexicon.
(For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).
These classes of verbs are defined by Perlmutter only in syntactic terms.
* the relationship of lexical meaning to sentence meaning and syntax.
The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path.
A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items.
''The doors had just been shut to keep out the bugs but Sally opened
there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure.
Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words.
''*I gave its owner every paycheck.''
''Thilo cooked kisimen for Satoshi''.
Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of affixes) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts.
They have the following structures underlyingly:
John  '''broke'''   the vase
The recursion found under the "umbrella" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s.
Richard Kayne proposed the idea of unambiguous paths as an alternative to c-commanding relationships, which is the type of structure seen in examples (8).
Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.
''Die Tür öffnete '''sich'''.''
''The knot loosened.''
Their hypothesis shows that there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can be invisible), thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right).
Beck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can.
For example, the predicates ''went'' and ''is here'' below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.
This brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.
Essentially, the idea that under the Extended Projection Principle there is a local boundary under which a special meaning occurs.
), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb.
In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously.
''Predicates'' are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence.
''Satoshi sent Tubingen the Damron Guide.
''Satoshi sent the Damron Guide to Tubingen''.
In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb.
This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument.
(16) ''Sally opened the door again''.
It appears as if the verb ''send'' has two objects, or complements (arguments): both ''Mary'', the recipient and ''parcel'', the theme.
Generative linguists of the 1960s, including Noam Chomsky and Ernst von Glasersfeld, believed semantic relations between transitive verbs and intransitive verbs were tied to their independent syntactic organization.
the  vase  '''broke'''
These probing techniques analyzed negative data over prescriptive grammars, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP.
Linguist Martin Haspelmath classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations.
