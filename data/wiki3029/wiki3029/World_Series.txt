The Padres have two World Series appearances (a 1984 loss to the Detroit Tigers, and a 1998 loss to the New York Yankees).
But as these teams do not feature the best talent from each nation, the public generally does not give much weight to the result of these tournaments.
The Blue Jays and the Marlins have never lost a World Series.
Prior to 1924, the pattern had been to alternate by game or to make another arrangement convenient to both clubs.

The 1993 World Series was also notable for being only the second championship concluded by a home run and the first concluded by a come-from-behind homer, after Joe Carter's three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning sealed an 8–6 Toronto win in Game 6.

At least one New York team has been in 54 World Series (49%) of Series played.
Prior to 2003, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the NL and AL.
