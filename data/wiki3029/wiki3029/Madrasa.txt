When articles mentioned "madrassas," readers were led to infer that all schools so-named are anti-American, anti-Western, pro-terrorist centres having less to do with teaching basic literacy and more to do with political indoctrination.
In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective authority of the faculty, the Islamic degree was not granted by the teacher to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a "personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one".
"When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, Murad II brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance the reputation of the Ottoman medrese".
This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on.
Western commentators post-9/11 often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of anti-Americanism and radical extremism, frequently associated in the Western press with Wahhabi attitudes toward non-Muslims.
Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars.
Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including "the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'chairman' of their subject" being based on the "traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him", the term 'academic circles' being derived from the way in which Islamic students "sat in a circle around their professor", and terms such as "having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back" to the Islamic concepts of '''' ('companions, as of Muhammad'), '''' ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and '''' ('licence to teach') respectively.

Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach "proper religious values."

There are six Madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or "Pre-U", at several schools).
Despite the many similarities, medieval specialists have coined the term "Islamic college" for madrasa and '''' to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval European universities were.
Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.
Arabic colleges (over eleven of which exist within the state-run University of Calicut and the Kannur University) provide B.A.
In countries like India, not all students in madrasas are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum.
Medievalist specialists who define the university as a legally autonomous corporation disagree with the term "university" for the Islamic madaris and ''jāmi‘ah''s because the medieval university (from Latin ''universitas'') was structurally different, being a legally autonomous corporation rather than a ''waqf'' institution like the madrasa and ''''.
While the madrasa college could also issue degrees at all levels, the ''jāmiʻah''s (such as  and al-Azhar University) differed in the sense that they were larger institutions, more universal in terms of their complete source of studies, had individual faculties for different subjects, and could house a number of mosques, madaris, and other institutions within them.
For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.

Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having "common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy.
