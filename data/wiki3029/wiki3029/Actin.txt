This is because in many cases the mutant of the actin monomer acts as a “cap” by preventing the elongation of F-actin.
However, there is not only one type of actin, the genes that code for actin are defined as a gene family (a family that in plants contains more than 60 elements, including genes and pseudogenes and in humans more than 30 elements).
It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti.
However the use of antibodies directed against different actin isoforms '''allows identifying not only the''' '''cytoplasmic beta in the cell nucleus''', but also:
The existence of a number of point mutations have also been found:
In contractile bundles, the actin-bundling protein alpha-actinin separates each thin filament by ~35&nbsp;nm.
The CCT then causes actin's sequential folding by forming bonds with its subunits rather than simply enclosing it in its cavity.
In addition to the similarities that exist between an organism’s isoforms there is also an evolutionary conservation in the structure and function even between organisms contained in different eukaryotic domains: in bacteria the actin homologue MreB has been identified, which is a protein that is capable of polymerizing into microfilaments; and in archaea the homologue Ta0583 is even more similar to the eukaryotic actins.
Scanning electron microscope images indicate that G-actin has a  globular structure; however, X-ray crystallography shows that each of these globules consists of two lobes separated by a cleft.
Unlike other polymers, such as DNA, whose constituent elements are bound together with covalent bonds, the monomers of actin filaments are assembled by weaker bonds.
Little attention is paid to actin isoforms, however it has been shown that different isoforms of actin are present in the cell nucleus.
There are a number of different types of actin with slightly different structures and functions.
It is known that this ATPase is “active”, that is, its speed increases by some 40,000 times when the actin forms part of a filament.
The amino acid sequencing of actin was completed by M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973.
These extremely long microfilaments are located in networks and, in association with contractile proteins such as non-muscular myosin, they are involved in the movement of substances at an intracellular level.
Even though the majority of plant cells have a cell wall that defines their morphology and impedes their movement, their microfilaments can generate sufficient force to achieve a number of cellular activities, such as, the cytoplasmic currents generated by the microfilaments and myosin.
A symptom of nemalinic myopathy is that “Nemaline rods” appear in differing places in Type 1 muscle fibres.
It therefore plays an important role in embryogenesis, the healing of wounds and the invasivity of cancer cells.
Other approaches such as the use of cryo-electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation have recently allowed increasing resolution and better understanding of the nature of the interactions and conformational changes implicated in the formation of actin filaments.
Nuclear actin was first noticed and described in 1977 by Clark and Merriam.
This produces a conformational change, sometimes called G*-actin or F-actin monomer as it is very similar to the units that are located on the filament.
It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres.
Consistent with this complexity, its products are also found in a number of locations and they form part of a wide variety of processes (cytoskeleton, NuA4 histone-acyltransferase complex, cell nucleus) and in addition they are associated with the mechanisms of a great number of pathological processes (carcinomas, juvenile dystonia, infection mechanisms, nervous system malformations and tumour invasion, among others).
There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs in a manner that is in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectoral, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been hydrolysed.
It has been noted that the sequences translated from this locus and from that of β-actin are very similar to the predicted ones, suggesting a common ancestral sequence that suffered duplication and genetic conversion.
They possess a number of accessory proteins including ADF/cofilin, which has a molecular weight of 16kDa and is coded for by a single gene, called ''COF1''; Aip1, a cofilin cofactor that promotes the disassembly of microfilaments; Srv2/CAP, a process regulator related to adenylate cyclase proteins; a profilin with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa that is associated with actin monomers; and twinfilin, a 40 kDa protein involved in the organization of patches.
# Opening of the sarcoplasmic reticulum’s Ca2+ channels.
If we compare the filaments that only contain ADP-Actin with those that include ATP, in the former the critical constants are similar at both ends, while Cc for the other two nucleotides is different: At the (+) end Cc+=0.1 μM, while at the (-) end Cc−=0.8 μM, which gives rise to the following situations:
The course of the illness, its gravity and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found.
No mutations to this gene have been found that correspond to pathologies, although microarrays have shown that this protein is more often expressed in cases that are resistant to chemotherapy using cisplatin.
In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60-79 and the other between residues 170-198.
* Juvenile onset dystonia is a rare degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system; in particular, it affects areas of the neocortex and thalamus, where rod-like eosinophilic inclusions are formed.
This maintains the native form of the protein until its withdrawal denatures the actin monomer.
This means that the genetic information of each individual contains instructions that generate actin variants (called isoforms) that possess slightly different functions.
Although there is much debate on this issue, it seems certain that a "closed" conformation is required for the hydrolysis of ATP, and it is thought that the residues that are involved in the process move to the appropriate distance.
''In vitro'' production takes place in a sequential manner:  first, there is the "activation phase", when the bonding and exchange of divalent cations occurs in specific places on the G-actin, which is bound to ATP.
It was first sequenced by Hamada and co-workers in 1982, when it was found that it is interrupted by five introns.
* Thymosin β-4 is a 5 kDa protein that can bind with G-actin-ATP in a 1:1 stoichiometry; which means that one unit of thymosin β-4 binds to one unit of G-actin.
It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates.
The polymerization is also reduced by the limited access to actin monomers, which are bound in complexes with ABPs, mainly cofilin.
These filaments can be observed under the microscope thanks to fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin staining.
Recent studies have discovered “ACTC1” mutations that are implicated in two other pathological processes:  Infantile idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, and noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium.
Within ''Arabidopsis thaliana'', a dicotyledon used as a model organism, there are ten types of actin, nine types of α-tubulins, six β-tubulins, six profilins and dozens of myosins.
The most notable supersecondary structure is a five chain beta sheet that is composed of a β-meander and a β-α-β clockwise unit.
Some authors suggest that the ancestral protein that gave rise to the model eukaryotic actin resembles the proteins present in modern bacterial cytoskeletons.
The ''ACTG1'' locus codes for the cytosolic γ-actin protein that is responsible for the formation of cytoskeletal microfilaments.
The glutamic acid Glu137 is one of the key residues, which is located in subdomain 1.
* For G-actin-ATP concentrations less than Cc− but greater than Cc+ elongation occurs at the (+) end.
Microfilaments measure approximately 7 nm in diameter with the helix repeating every 37&nbsp;nm.
In this phase the filament forms and rapidly grows through the reversible addition of new monomers at both extremes.
In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules.
In addition, it is able to carry out more interactions than any other protein, which allows it to perform a wider variety of functions than other proteins at almost every level of cellular life.
''ACTA1'' is the gene that codes for the α-isoform of actin that is predominant in human skeletal striated muscles, although it is also expressed in heart muscle and in the thyroid gland.
The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments.
In either case, the resulting Pi is not released, it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin’s ADP, in this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin.
''ACTG2'' codes for the largest actin isoform, which has nine exons, one of which, the one located at the 5' end, is not translated.
The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues.
ParMs from different bacterial plasmids can form astonishingly diverse helical structures comprising two or four strands to maintain faithful plasmid inheritance.
As indicated above, although actin hydrolyzes ATP, everything points to the fact that ATP is not required for actin to be assembled, given that, on one hand, the hydrolysis mainly takes place inside the filament, and on the other hand the ADP could also instigate polymerization.
The high conservation of the family makes actin the favoured model for studies comparing the introns-early and introns-late models of intron evolution.
This is why it possesses specific recognition areas in its apical β-domain.
The highly dynamic microfilaments formed by the aggregation of MreB and ParM are essential to cell viability and they are involved in cell morphogenesis, chromosome segregation, and cell polarity.
Its location is regulated by cell membrane signal transduction pathways that integrate the stimuli that a cell receives stimulating the restructuring of the actin networks in response.
It also seems that in the case of actin, the CAP protein is required as a possible cofactor in actin's final folding states.
It can be present as either a free monomer called '''G-actin''' (globular) or as part of a linear polymer '''microfilament''' called '''F-actin''' (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.
In 1942, Straub developed a novel technique for extracting muscle protein that allowed him to isolate substantial amounts of relatively pure actin.
The lateral bonds with neighbouring monomers resolve this anomaly, which in theory should weaken the structure as they can be broken by thermal agitation.
In this case the control of the structure's size is totally apical and it is controlled in some way by gene expression, that is, by the total quantity of protein monomer synthesized in any given moment.
The mutations are in many cases associated with a phenotype that determines the severity and the course of the affliction.
Nuclear actin organization varies in different cell types.
It was demonstrated that a mutation preventing SUMOylation causes rapid export of beta actin from the nucleus.
There is a concentration of the network around the nucleus that is connected via spokes to the cellular cortex, this network is highly dynamic, with a continuous polymerization and depolymerization.
* Periodic actin rings.
However the in-strand contacts and nucleotide binding sites are preserved in prokaryotes and in archaea.
Myosin is an example of a protein that bonds with actin.
# Movement of myosin heads over the thin filaments, this can either involve ATP or be independent of ATP.
Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotes, where it is found throughout the cytoplasm.
The most notable proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton in plants include: villin, which belongs to the same family as gelsolin/severin and is able to cut microfilaments and bind actin monomers in the presence of calcium cations; fimbrin, which is able to recognize and unite actin monomers and which is involved in the formation of networks (by a different regulation process from that of animals and yeasts); formins, which are able to act as an F-actin polymerization nucleating agent; myosin, a typical molecular motor that is specific to eukaryotes and which in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' is coded for by 17 genes in two distinct classes; CHUP1, which can bind actin and is implicated in the spatial distribution of chloroplasts in the cell; KAM1/MUR3 that define the morphology of the Golgi apparatus as well as the composition of xyloglucans in the cell wall; NtWLIM1, which facilitates the emergence of actin cell structures; and ERD10, which is involved in the association of organelles within membranes and microfilaments and which seems to play a role that is involved in an organism’s reaction to stress.
Studies focusing on the accumulation and loss of subunits by microfilaments are carried out ''in vitro'' (that is, in the laboratory and not on cellular systems) as the polymerization of the resulting actin gives rise to the same F-actin as produced ''in vivo''.
This has led to the theory that the dilation is produced by a defect in the transmission of contractile force in the myocytes.
The hostilities of World War II meant Szent-Gyorgyi and Straub were unable to publish the work in Western scientific journals.
Straub's method is essentially the same as that used in laboratories today.
This weakens the strength of binding of these two proteins.
The crystallization of F-actin was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374.
Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin.
The most notable of these proteins are gelsolin and cofilin.
Recent investigations have tried to understand this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness.
The α-actin found in smooth muscles is also an interesting marker for evaluating the progress of liver cirrhosis.
Nucleating factors are necessary to stimulate actin polymerization.
In addition, as the latter types have a high turnover rate the majority of them are found outside permanent structures.
It is also implicated in other cellular functions, such as the binding of proline repetitions in other proteins or of lipids that act as  secondary messengers.
;Tertiary structure&nbsp;— domains
The first stage in the folding consists of the recognition of residues 245-249.
The contraction-relaxation cycle comprises the following steps:
It has been suggested that these centres may play a role in the polymerization of actin by acting during the activation stage.
Authors describe a protein present in the nuclear fraction, obtained from ''Xenopus laevis'' oocytes, which shows the same features such skeletal muscle actin.
A new form of actin has been discovered, kappa actin, which appears to substitute for β-actin in processes relating to tumours.
Many mutations occur in the region of actin’s indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins.
This model suggests that the polymerization and ATPase’s function would be decoupled straight away.
Based on the experimental results a '''general mechanism of nuclear actin transport''' can be proposed:
This gives rise to a naming convention: the end that possesses an actin subunit that has its ATP binding site exposed is called the "(-) end", while the opposite end where the cleft is directed at a different adjacent monomer is called the "(+) end".
# Increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and the interaction of these cations with troponin causing a conformational change in its structure.
As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip.
In fact, this is true only in smooth muscle, and was not supported through experimentation until 2001.
Mutations have also been found that produce “core” myopathies).
Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different "structural states".
The F-actin polymer is considered to have structural polarity due to the fact that all the microfilament’s subunits point towards the same end.
This model suggests that a filament is formed by monomers in a "sheet" formation, in which the subdomains turn about themselves, this form is also found in the bacterial actin homologue MreB.
Low level of actin in the nucleus seems to be very important, because actin has two nuclear export signals (NES) into its sequence.
The former mechanism, mediated by ATPase activity in the myosin heads, causes the movement of the actin filaments towards the Z-disc.
This calcium is coordinated with six water molecules that are retained by the amino acids Asp11, Asp154, and Gln137.
The mutations in”ACTC1” are responsible for at least 5% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies.
Both extremes are in close proximity within the I-subdomain.
Changes in actin’s folding occur in nemaline myopathy as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins.
However, there is still no high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin.
The most commonly found forms of actin, compared to all the possible combinations, are ATP-G-Actin and ADP-F-actin.
Then, the Pi remains bound to the actin next to the ADP for a long time, until it is liberated next to the end of the filament.
'''Actin''' is a family of globular multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments.
In fact, in muscle fibres it comprises 20% of total cellular protein by weight and between 1% and 5% in other cells.
Animal cells commonly have a cell cortex under the cell membrane that contains a large number of microfilaments, which precludes the presence of organelles.
In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 Å while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen.
'''The controlled level of actin in the nucleus, its interaction with actin-binding proteins (ABP) and the presence of different isoforms allows actin to play an important role in many important nuclear processes'''.
The majority of these consist of point mutations causing substitution of amino acids.
The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility.
In actin’s case, two subunits are bound during each conformational change, whereas for tubulin binding takes place with four subunits.
Actin complexes with prefoldin while it is still being formed, when it is approximately 145 amino acids long, specifically those at the N-terminal.
Another example is villin, which can weave actin into bundles or cut the filaments depending on the concentration of calcium cations in the surrounding medium.
The residues that are involved are Asp11-Lys18 and Asp154-His161 respectively.
The bacterial cytoskeleton may not be as complex as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers.
This mechanism is responsible for muscle contraction and cytokinesis, the division of one cell into two.
The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic faces), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties.
Within the sarcomere (the basic morphological and physiological unit of muscle fibres) actin is present in both the I and A bands; myosin is also present in the latter.
* Microfilament bundles.
This complex is actively imported into the nucleus.
The exact manner by which this process is regulated is still not fully understood, but it is known that the protein PhLP3 (a protein similar to phosducin) inhibits its activity through the formation of a tertiary complex.
However, the way it acquires its fully functional form from its newly synthesized native form is special and almost unique in protein chemistry.
It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help of molecular motors.
Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.
In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins.
* Microfilament networks.
Its role is to impede the incorporation of the monomers into the growing polymer.
For example, the protein that is coded by the ''ACTG2'' gene in humans is completely equivalent to the homologues present in rats and mice, even though at a nucleotide level the similarity decreases to 92%.
This in turn alters the structure of tropomyosin, which covers actin’s active site, allowing the formation of myosin-actin cross-links (the latter being present as thin filaments).
It is an γ-actin that is expressed in the enteric smooth muscle.
However, there are major differences with the equivalents in prokaryotes (FtsZ and MreB), where the similarity between nucleotide sequences is between 40−50 % among different bacteria and archaea species.
Actin is an ATPase, which means that it is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP.
The typical actin gene has an approximately 100-nucleotide 5' UTR, a 1200-nucleotide translated region, and a 200-nucleotide 3' UTR.
* In non-muscle cells, to be a track for cargo transport myosins (nonconventional myosins) such as myosin V and VI.
These fibrils comprise the mechanism of muscle contraction.
Yeasts contain three main elements that are associated with actin: patches, cables and rings that, despite being present for long, are subject to a dynamic equilibrium due to continual polymerization and depolymerization.
It has been related to Moyamoya disease and it seems likely that certain mutations in heterozygosis could confer a predisposition to many vascular pathologies, such as thoracic aortic aneurysm and ischaemic heart disease.
'''The presence of different isoforms of actin may have a significant effect on its function in nuclear processes''', especially because the level of individual isoforms can be controlled independently.
Its N-terminus is highly acidic and starts with an acetyled aspartate in its amino group.
They also shows different localization and functions.
There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these are the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T and troponin C.
* P166A: interaction zone between actin monomers.
Bacteria therefore possess a cytoskeleton with homologous elements to actin (for example, MreB, ParM, and MamK), even though the amino acid sequence of these proteins diverges from that present in animal cells.
In addition, the configuration of the different monomer types is detected by actin binding proteins, which also control this dynamism, as will be described in the following section.
Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes.
However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.
This complex is also required in more complicated processes such as in establishing dendritic structures and also in anastomosis (the reconnection of two branching structures that had previously been joined, such as in blood vessels).
Straub suggested that the transformation of ATP-bound actin to ADP-bound actin played a role in muscular contraction.
Different recognition sub-units are used for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap.
In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods.
Each molecule of actin is bound to a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that is associated with a Mg2+ cation.
Microinjected actin is quickly removed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
Six autosomal-dominant point mutations in the sequence have been found to cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus.
This structure represents the “ATPase fold”, which is a centre of enzymatic catalysis that binds ATP and Mg2+ and hydrolyzes the former to ADP plus phosphate.
It has been noted that the MYH11 mutation could be responsible for at least 14% of hereditary thoracic aortic aneurisms particularly Type 6.
Next, other determinants establish contact.
An anomalous ''N''τ-methylhistidine is located at position 73.
Actin’s cytoskeleton is key to the processes of endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts.
Actin was first observed experimentally in 1887 by W.D.
* For G-actin-ATP concentrations less than Cc+ no elongation of the filament occurs.
The affected individuals represent a phenotype with deformities on the median line, sensory hearing loss and dystonia.
Nevertheless, it is key to establishing the stability of the cytoskeleton, and additionally, it is an essential process for coordinating the cell cycle.
Under normal “in vitro” conditions Cc is 0.1 μM, which means that at higher values polymerization occurs and at lower values depolymerization occurs.
Actin networks are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of cells that have been cultivated ''in vitro''.
The majority of actin genes are interrupted by introns, with up to six introns in any of 19 well-characterised locations.
F-actin can also be described as a microfilament.
A number of structural disorders associated with point mutations of this gene have been described that cause malfunctioning of the heart, such as Type 1R dilated cardiomyopathy and Type 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The actin cytoskeleton ''in vivo'' is not exclusively composed of actin, other proteins are required for its formation, continuance and function.
For contraction, the myosin molecule is usually bound to two separate filaments and both ends simultaneously "walk" toward their filament's plus end, sliding the actin filaments closer to each other.
The reason for this special route could be the need to avoid the presence of incorrectly folded actin monomers, which could be toxic as they can act as inefficient polymerization terminators.
* Actin is SUMOylated and in this form retain inside nucleus.
There is less agreement regarding measurements of the turn radius and filament thickness: while the first models assigned a longitude of 25 Å, current X-ray diffraction data, backed up by cryo-electron microscopy suggests a longitude of 23.7 Å.
* Higher concentration of ATP in the nucleus (compared to the cytoplasm) promote ADP to ATP exchange in the actin-cofilin complex.
Actin’s affinity for profilin is greatly reduced in this allele.
Actin is found in both smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulums.
Precisely controlled level of actin in the cell nucleus, lower than in the cytoplasm, prevents the formation of filaments.
Szent-Gyorgyi had previously described the more viscous form of myosin produced by slow muscle extractions as 'activated' myosin, and, since Straub's protein produced the activating effect, it was dubbed ''actin''.
The ''in vivo'' process is controlled by a multitude of proteins in order to make it responsive to cellular demands, this makes it difficult to observe its basic conditions.
Its function is to bind the water molecule that produces a nucleophilic attack on the ATP’s γ-phosphate bond, while the nucleotide is strongly bound to subdomains 3 and 4.
This justifies the expenditure of energy as it promotes essential biological functions.
The majority of mammals possess six different actin genes.
An actin protein's mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7&nbsp;nm, and it is the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells.
Its amino acid sequence is also one of the most highly conserved of the proteins as it has changed little over the course of evolution, differing by no more than 20% in species as diverse as algae and humans.
Examples of this type of protein are CapZ (that binds the (+) ends depending on a cell’s levels of Ca2+/calmodulin.
Finally, a "stationary equilibrium" is achieved where the G-actin monomers are exchanged at both ends of the microfilament without any change to its total length.
For example, if a microfilament with two ends is cut twice, there will be three new microfilaments with six ends.
