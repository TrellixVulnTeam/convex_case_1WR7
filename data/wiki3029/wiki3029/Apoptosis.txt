'''Apoptosis''' (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις "falling off") is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.
The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results.
As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors.
Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second ''p'' silent ( ) and the second ''p'' pronounced (), as in the original Greek.
Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the cell's cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondia membranes.
A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.

Cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.
Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name ''apoptosis'' (as opposed to the more general ''programmed cell death'') is unclear.
In a living organism, this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder.
The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC.
An example of this can be seen in HeLa cells, whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected.
In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death.
Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage.
A selection of techniques that can be used to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references.
In other types of cells (type II), the ''Fas''-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.
