Moisture makes the cortex become more transparent.
Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus.
The genus is more closely allied to endomycorrhizal genera.
The following table lists the orders and families of fungi that include lichen-forming species.
These growth form groups are not precisely defined.
This is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms, which would be considered different species by any measure other than the DNA of the fungal component.
Lichen properties such as growth form, physiology, and biochemistry, are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae and/or cyanobacteria.
Re-configuration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes or more.
and thin filaments (mucoromycotinan Glomeromycota?)
The algae or cyanobacteria benefit from being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungus, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it.
The algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungus, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it.
Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: Cyanophyceae; eukaryotic: Trebouxiophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Chlorophyceae) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.
A crustose lichen that grows on bark is called a '''corticolous lichen'''.
Foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose.
Common algal photobionts are from the genus ''Trebouxia'', ''Trentepohlia'', ''Pseudotrebouxia'', or ''Myrmecia (algae)''.
Depending on context, "lichenized fungus" may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus when it is in the lichen, which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria.
These organic acids are the metabolic byproducts of Crassulacean acid metabolism, the means of photosynthesis by lichens.
Lichens that use leaves as substrates, whether the leaf is still on the tree or on the ground, are called '''epiphyllous''' or '''foliicolous'''.
and ''Tuckermannopsis'' sp.
# byssoid – wispy, like teased wool
When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as a structureless, undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments (hyphae).
By convention, lichens have the same scientific name as the fungus in them, and are not classified according to the species of the algae and/or cyanobacteria growing in them.
Lichens produce allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the growth of mosses.
The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera ''Rhizocarpon'' (e.g.
Lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi.
A particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species, giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species, but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species.
There are  fossilized lichens embedded in amber.
Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes.
The top layer, where the lichen contacts the environment, is called a '''cortex'''.
When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites and only use the plants as a substrate.
Although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time, it was not until 1867, when Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener proposed his dual theory of lichens, that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge.
'''Isidia''' (singular "isidium") are branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal.
There is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus, and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium (synecdoche).
Fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy.
The long life-span and slow and regular growth rate of some lichens can be used to date events (lichenometry).
Many lichens have apothecia that are visible to the naked eye.
This is called being rimose or areolate, and the "island" pieces separated by the cracks are called areolas.
The algal or cyanobacterial cells are photosynthetic and, as in plants, they reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts.
Notice the red tips.
Fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the "stems" and "branches".
Rock tripe (''Umbilicaria'' spp.
The fungus is called a '''mycobiont'''.
When the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called '''lecanorine''', meaning similar to members of the genus ''Lecanora''.
Most metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities.
When the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified, Schwendener's hypothesis began to gain popularity.
This interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859, with more systematic methods developed by William Nylander in 1866.
Lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli.
Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own (vegetative reproduction) or through the dispersal of diaspores containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells.
These fossils are thought to be 551 to 635 million years old or Ediacaran.
Many of these characterize the Lobarion communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the Celtic Rainforest.
The most common types of ascomata are the '''apothecium''' (plural: apothecia) and '''perithecium''' (plural: perithecia).
The prokaryotes are blue green "algae" (cyanobacteria).
The same fungus growing in combination with different algae and/or cyanobacteria, can produce lichens that are very different in most properties, meeting non-DNA criteria for being different "species".
Gelatinous, byssoid, and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are ecorticate), and generally have only undifferentiated tissue, similar to only having a symbiont layer.
are permineralized in marine phosphorite of the Doushantuo Formation in southern China.
Some people who study lichens (lichenologists) group squamulose lichens separately from crustose lichens.
The underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side (dorsiventral), often brown or black, sometimes white.
The apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called '''asci''' (singular – ascus), and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue.
Fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the "branches".
Recent perspectives on lichens include that they are relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves, possibly with more microorganisms living with the fungi, algae, and/or cyanobacteria, performing other functions as partners in a system that evolves as an even more complex composite organism (holobiont).
In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below.
Orcein and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.
The fungal component of a lichen is called the '''mycobiont'''.
(2001) indicate that lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses.
Lichen-like fossils consisting of coccoid cells (cyanobacteria?)
The oldest fossil lichens in which both symbiotic partners have been recovered date to the Early Devonian Rhynie chert, about 400 million years old.
They can survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps.
The properties are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants.
Lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of Baelo Claudia Spain.
Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world.
About 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts, and about 10 have cyanobionts.
Neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form monophyletic lineages in their respective fungal phyla, but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum.
Although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen, the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners, whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic.
''Geosiphon'' is not usually considered to be a lichen, and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years.
Consequently, many environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective biomonitors of atmospheric quality.
In British English, both this pronunciation and one rhyming with "kitchen" ) are used.
The associated lichens are called either '''ascolichens''' or '''basidiolichens''', respectively.
If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges, in the process called morphogenesis.
Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the photobiont component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species.
The layer beneath the symbiont layer called is called the '''medulla'''.
Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by an haustorium.
Some lichens do not grow on anything, living out their lives blowing about the environment.
Not all lichens are equally sensitive to air pollutants, so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants.
A prominent example is the alga ''Trentepohlia'', which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces.
Usnic acid is the most commonly studied metabolite produced by lichens and has been associated with the suppression of tuberculosis.
A '''vagrant lichen''' is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.
# crustose – crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint
The photobiont in lichens come from a wide variety of simple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals, contributing to the process of weathering by which rocks are gradually turned into soil.
This secretion layer may or may not have pores.
Many squamulous lichens are terricolous.
Similarly ''Peltigera leucophlebia'' was used as a supposed cure for thrush, due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease.
Lichens are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus in them, which may cause some confusion.
Different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces, or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors "come to life" or "glow" in brilliant displays following rain.
Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in vulpinic acid or usnic acid are toxic.
The same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners.
Lichens come in many colors, sizes, and forms.
Lichens are grouped by thallus type, since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen.
The thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately.
The extreme habitats that lichens dominate, such as tundra, mountains, and deserts, are not ordinarily conducive to producing fossils.
The slightly older fossil ''Spongiophyton'' has also been interpreted as a lichen on morphological and isotopic grounds, although the isotopic basis is decidedly shaky.
A lichen is made up of a simple photosynthesizing organism, usually green algae or cyanobacteria, surrounded by filaments of a fungus.

Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as saprotrophs or plant parasites (for example, the Leotiales, Dothideales, and Pezizales).
After 15 days, the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be in full health with no discernible damage from their time in orbit.
The lichen combination of alga and/or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology), physiology, and biochemistry than the component fungus, alga, or cyanobacterium growing by itself, naturally or in culture.
Many lichens also grow as epiphytes (''epi''- on the surface, ''phyte''- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees.
An article published in ''PLoS ONE'' indicates that a serine protease isolated from certain species of lichen degrades prions.
Many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used in cheaply assessing air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination.
Photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange.
they are homothallic).
There are about 20,000 known lichen species.
When a crustose lichen gets old, the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint, old-broken asphalt paving, or like the polygonal "islands" of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed.
The fungus benefits from the symbiotic relation because algae or cyanobacteria produce food by photosynthesis.
Lichens may be long-lived (longevity), with some considered to be among the oldest living things.
They usually bear the fungal pycnidia or apothecia or both.
Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species.
The alga bears its own scientific name, which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungus.
Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont.
The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the substrate.
The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, similar to the anatomy of a leaf.
'''Lichenized fungus''' may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus growing in it.
Lichens may be important in contributing nitrogen to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting the nitrogen into the soils.
A '''lichen''' is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a symbiotic relationship.
The fungus benefits from the algae or cyanobacteria because they produce food by photosynthesis.
the species ''Rhizocarpon geographicum'') and ''Xanthoria''.
There are reports dating almost 2000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes.
''Trebouxia'' is the most common genus of green algae in lichens, occurring in about 40% of all lichens.
It is thought that lichens may be even more complex symbiotic systems that include non-photosynthetic bacterial communities performing other functions as partners in a holobiont.
Here, "macro" and "micro" do not refer to size, but to the growth form.
Most crustose lichens grow only 1–2&nbsp;mm in diameter per year.
The medulla is the lowest layer, and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus, or it may be hollow.
in the Canadian Rockies
Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), or other growth forms.
File:Fruticose lichen branches blackpine lake.jpg|''Letharia'' sp.
Other common cyanobacterium photobionts are from ''Scytonema''.
These lichens are at least several decades old.
The shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments.
File:Kananakislichen.jpg|''Hypogymnia'' cf.
Like some mosses, liverworts, ferns, and a few "resurrection plants", upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as cryptobiosis) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity.
The areolas appear separated, but are (or were) connected by an underlying "prothallus" or "hypothallus".
The fungi of some lichen species may "take over" the algae of other lichen species.
If a cyanobacterium is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can fix atmospheric nitrogen, complementing the activities of the green alga.
Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs and monuments.
The nonreproductive tissues, or vegetative body parts, is called the '''thallus'''.
When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called '''lirellae'''.
In American English, "lichen" is pronounced the same as the verb "liken" ().
In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall, forming penetration pegs (haustoria) similar to those produced by fungi that feed on a host (pathogenic fungi).
Coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component.
Common names for lichens often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen genus.
Lichens are not parasites on the plants they grow on, but only use them as a substrate to grow on.
Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested reindeer lichen (''Cladina'' spp.)
Ediacaran acritarchs also have many similarities with Glomeromycotan vesicles and spores.
Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent.
Lichenized and nonlichenized fungi can even be found in the same genus or species.
Of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family Roccellaceae, commonly called orchella weed or orchil.
File:Lichen growing on concrete dust (2010 04 08).jpg|&nbsp; Microscopic view of lichen growing on a piece of concrete dust.
Lichens may be long-lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living things.
In tests, lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).
There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is parasitic or commensalistic, rather than mutualistic.
Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years.
Therefore, lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances, but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other.
The processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include fog and dew, gaseous absorption, and dry deposition.
The alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association.
Lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment.
But what is meant by "species" is different from what is meant by biological species in plants, animals, or fungi, where being the same species implies that there is a common ancestral lineage.
The fungal, algal, or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture.
Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories.
Lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria at least twice in history.
Wila (''Bryoria fremontii'') was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked.
A fruticose lichen may have flattened "branches", appearing similar to a foiliose lichen, but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the ''same'' color as the top side.
In the arctic tundra, lichens, together with mosses and liverworts, make up the majority of the ground cover, which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals.
Means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below.
Thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen.
Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus ''Cladina'' (reindeer lichens), produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants.
Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places, such as the vertical "paint" covering the vast rock faces of Yosemite National Park.
The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa.
Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns.
# foliose – growing in 2-dimensional, flat, leaf-like lobes that lift up from the surface
Lichenized Glomeromycota may extend well back into the Precambrian.
Lichens are really combinations of species from two or three different biological kingdoms, so there is no common lineage.
Formerly, some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division, the '''Mycophycophyta''', but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate lineages.
Algal photobionts are called '''phycobionts'''.
Lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead, copper, and radionuclides.
Phycobionts (algae) produce sugar alcohols (ribitol, sorbitol, and erythritol), which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus).
Stability (that is, longevity) of their substrate is a major factor of lichen habitats.
Orange and yellow lichens add to the ambience of desert trees, rock faces, tundras, and rocky seashores.
Lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms (morphologies).
Common names for lichens may contain the word "moss" (e.g., "Reindeer moss", "Iceland moss"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant.
Below the cortex layer is a layer called the '''photobiontic layer''' or '''symbiont layer'''.
In lichens that include both green algal ''and'' cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called '''cephalodia'''.
These may be dramatic in color or appearance.
with ''Bryoria'' sp.
Two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens, but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen.
In an experiment led by Leopoldo Sancho from the Complutense University of Madrid, two species of lichen—''Rhizocarpon geographicum'' and ''Xanthoria elegans''—were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket 31 May 2005.
''tubulosa'' with ''Bryoria'' sp.
While this contribution to weathering is usually benign, it can cause problems for artificial stone structures.
"Pd" refers to the outcome of the Pd test or is used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test, para-phenylenediamine.
File:Reddish-colored lichen on volcanic rock.jpg|''Xanthoria'' sp.
In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit.
