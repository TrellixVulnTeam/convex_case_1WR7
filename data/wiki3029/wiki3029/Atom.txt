The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force.
Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals.
A more area-selective method is electron energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron microscope when it interacts with a portion of a sample.
Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks.
The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.
At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose–Einstein condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.
The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more).
If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.
This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately .
Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells.
The number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom.
Valency is the combining power of an element.
Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400–700&nbsp;nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope.
Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.
The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.
This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.
As a result, their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect.
These superheavy elements may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.
Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei.

For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive muon, forming a muonic atom.
It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms.
In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation.
Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond.
The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in a given atom is called the mass number.
Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as radium from uranium), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).
This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105&nbsp;fm.

It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction.
It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.
Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels.
There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge.
A year later, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.

In the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions).
In ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment.
These colors can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp containing the same element.
In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus.
Where the temperature is much higher than ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons.
Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.
Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first ''subatomic'' particle to be discovered, which he originally called "''corpuscle''" but was later named ''electron'', after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874.
Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.

Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.
When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level.
For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists.
For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.
For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease.
However, atoms do not have well-defined boundaries, and there are different ways to define their size that give different but close values.
In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure.
Since the Big Bang, which produced no carbon or heavier elements, atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium, and (via the triple alpha process) the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron; see stellar nucleosynthesis for details.
These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.
Under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.
Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting.
Though the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles.
It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count.
This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen.
Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits ''identical'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.
* Gamma decay: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation.
If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion.
Neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks.

Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.
For example, it requires only 13.6&nbsp;eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23&nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus.
For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon.
Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure.
Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.
An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV).
The chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table.
The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction.

However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even in theory.
Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000&nbsp;years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination, when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.
However, as the atomic number increases, a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons.
The Stern–Gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom.
For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus.
Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about 10% of the mass of the galaxy.
Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of —although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.
Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.

This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.
Chemical bonds between atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.
The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.
The potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance.
It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured.
However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model.

When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field.
In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.
Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state.
The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge.

However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation.
Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus.
Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.
The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e.

These are also formally classified as "stable".
Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton.
An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays.
The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino.
To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.
Dependence of the energy on  is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.
