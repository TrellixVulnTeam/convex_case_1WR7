The local gravitational acceleration at the poles is greater than at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles.
For comparison, the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about ZSol&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0172&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.002.
The Assyrians named this pole star Dayan-same, the "Judge of Heaven", while in Akkadian it was Tir-anna, "Life of Heaven".
Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region—wavelength range 350–850 nanometers, most of which can be seen with the human eye—so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000–4000&nbsp;Jy.
The first person to publish a star's parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve, when he announced a value of 0.125&nbsp;arcseconds (0.125″) for Vega.
Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega's main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, a tenth of the Sun's.
The energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources.
At present, Vega has more than twice the mass of the Sun and its full luminosity is about 40 times the Sun's value.

In the Galactic coordinate system, the space velocity components of Vega are (U, V, W) = , for a net space velocity of 19&nbsp;km/s.
One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan.
Following the discovery of an infrared excess around Vega, other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission.
However, because of its high rate of rotation, the pole is considerably brighter than the equator.

The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46.
Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.
Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of .
In 2003 it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65&nbsp;AU over 56&nbsp;million&nbsp;years, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega.
In Babylonian astronomy, Vega may have been one of the stars named Dilgan, "the Messenger of Light".
However, the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear.
Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.
Thus, for many years, Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales.
Determining the nature of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an eccentric orbit.
At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega.
This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100&nbsp;μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10&nbsp;arcseconds (10″) centered on the star.
This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Vega located at its right angle.
Subsequent measurements of Vega at 193&nbsp;μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, suggesting that they must instead be on the order of 100&nbsp;μm or less.
Astronomers at the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii and at UCLA suggested that the image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation.
Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.

On July 17, 1850, Vega became the first star (other than the Sun) to be photographed, when it was imaged by William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory, also with a daguerreotype.
(Compare this, for example, to a three-fold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun.)
For a period of history it marked the start of their new year when the ground would be prepared for planting.
The metallicity of Vega's photosphere is only about 32% of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun's atmosphere.
This rapid rotation of Vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge, so the radius of the equator is 19% larger than the polar radius.
Although a planet has yet to be directly observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be precluded.
Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'.
No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet.
Because it is seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity from Earth is notably higher, about 57 times the Sun's value.
This is seen as a variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000&nbsp;K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600&nbsp;K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole.
Vega is one of six A0V stars that were used to set the initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in the 1950s.
Based on this star's kinematic properties, it appears to belong to a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group.
As Vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric.
The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included ''Vega'' for this star.
To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths.

Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun.
Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded.
For the Roman Empire, the start of autumn was based upon the hour at which Vega set below the horizon.
The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.
Among the northern Polynesian people, Vega was known as ''whetu o te tau'', the year star.
One of the early results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the discovery of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone.
The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region.
Motion transverse to the line of sight causes the position of Vega to shift with respect to the more distant background stars.
The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as:  =  =&nbsp;0.
The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric.
The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.
This is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun.
This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System.
It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements.

The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium.
The net proper motion of Vega is 327.78&nbsp;mas/y, which results in angular movement of a degree every 11,000&nbsp;years.
From the Earth, this bulge is being viewed from the direction of its pole, producing the overly large radius estimate.
The radial velocity of Vega is the component of this star's motion along the line-of-sight to the Earth.
It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.
However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared, and is near 100 Jy at 5&nbsp;micrometers.
(The estimated polar radius of this star is solar radii, while the equatorial radius is  solar radii.)
A complete precession cycle requires 25,770&nbsp;years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars.
Eventually this function became denoted by the Pleiades.
This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega.
The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.
At 5480&nbsp;Å, the flux is 3,650&nbsp;Jy with an error margin of 2%.
The UBV photometric system measures the magnitude of stars through ultraviolet, blue, and yellow filters, producing ''U'', ''B'', and ''V'' values, respectively.
This change cast further doubt on Struve's data.
By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had produced high-resolution infrared images of the dust around Vega.
The Japanese Tanabata festival, in which Vega is known as ''orihime'' (織姫), is also based on this legend.
But Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314″ for the star system 61 Cygni, Struve revised his value for Vega's parallax to nearly double the original estimate.
However, images by the Keck telescope had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16, which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times the mass of Jupiter.
However, Struve's initial result was actually surprisingly close to the currently accepted value of 0.129″, as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite.
Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness.
This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega's variability has been controversial.
Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result.
Hence it is more likely to have been produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies.
The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.
Most of the energy produced at Vega's core is generated by the carbon&ndash;nitrogen&ndash;oxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
The radial component of this velocity—in the direction of the Sun—is −13.9&nbsp;km/s, while the transverse velocity is 9.9&nbsp;km/s.
The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the David Dunlap Observatory and showed some slight variability.
However, continuous production of the amount of dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter.
In 2015, star spots were detected on the star's surface—the first such detection for a normal A-type star, and these features show evidence of rotational modulation with a period of 0.68&nbsp;days.
The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent.
The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward.

Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation.
Also, a 2011 article affirms on its abstract that "The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed".
This process requires a temperature of about 15&nbsp;million&nbsp;K, which is higher than the core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction.
This may be caused by an intense bombardment of comets or meteors, and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system.
Other vehicles named after Vega include the ESA's Vega launch system and the Lockheed Vega aircraft.
In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The term "Al Nesr al Waki" appeared in the Al Achsasi al Mouakket star catalogue and was translated into Latin as ''Vultur Cadens'', "the falling eagle/vulture".
This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.
Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.
The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star.
These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen Balmer series.
From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.
Movement away from the Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower frequency (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion is toward the Earth.
This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.
Vega's spectral class is A0V, making it a blue-tinged white main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core.
(2012) and the Herschel Space Telescope.
This was hypothesized as either a perturbation of the dust disk by a planet or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust.
Astrophotography, the photography of celestial objects, began in 1840 when John William Draper took an image of the Moon using the daguerreotype process.
This may be caused by the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface.
When the radius of Vega was measured to high accuracy with an interferometer, it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of  times the radius of the Sun.
However, one day per year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, magpies make a bridge so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nü can be together again for a brief encounter.
Originating within 8&nbsp;AU of the star, this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system.
To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required.
Thus, in terms of abundances, only about 0.54% of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium.

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria named it as ''Neilloan'', "the flying Loan".
However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux.
A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in the process of collapsing to form a planet.
The constellation was represented as a vulture in ancient Egypt, and as an eagle or vulture in ancient India.
The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium.
Although Vega is at present only the fifth-brightest star in the sky, the star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach the Sun.
In Hindu mythology, Vega is called Abhijit.
This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star.
Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement.
The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes.
Astronomers term "metals" those elements with higher atomic numbers than helium.
Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies.
This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.
At the high end of estimates for the rotation velocity for Vega is  along the equator, which is 87.6% of the speed that would cause the star to start breaking up from centrifugal effects.
These much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50&nbsp;μm in size.
Medieval astrologers counted Vega as one of the Behenian stars and related it to chrysolite and winter savory.
However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain.
This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.
Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound.
This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.
Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a Delta Scuti variable.
Vega became the first solitary main-sequence star beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands Missile Range.
This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles.
Henry Draper took the first photograph of a star's spectrum in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega, and he also became the first person to show absorption lines in the spectrum of a star.
As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star.
After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M red giant and shed much of its mass, finally becoming a white dwarf.
In 1879, William Huggins used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve "very strong lines" that were common to this stellar category.
Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used the names Wega and Alvaca, and depicted it and Altair as birds.

230, Verses 8–11): "Contesting against Abhijit (Vega), the constellation Krittika (Pleiades) went to "Vana" the summer solstice to heat the summer.
As of 2002, about 400 of these stars have been found, and they have come to be termed "Vega-like" or "Vega-excess" stars.
Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.
With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow for improved instrument calibrations.

It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274&nbsp;km/s at the equator.
The Arabic name then appeared in the western world in the Alfonsine Tables, which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of Alfonso&nbsp;X.
Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000.
The unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak Lambda Boötis-type star.
However, this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from the direction of its pole of rotation.
Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign  under ''Vultur cadens'', a literal Latin translation of the Arabic name.
It is believed that these may provide clues to the origin of the Solar System.
However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that "A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1-2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean".
In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars.
The distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun.
Vega's proper motion is  (mas) per year in right ascension—the celestial equivalent of longitude—and  in declination, which is equivalent to a change in latitude.
The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward.
Careful measurement of the star's position allows this angular movement, known as proper motion, to be calculated.
Each night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates.
The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer.
