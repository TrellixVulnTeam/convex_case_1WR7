Her altar stood at the base of the steps, at the proscenium's edge.
Some city-states, notably Athens, evoked her as a protector, but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign, exotic mystery-goddess who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following.
Literary sources describe joyous abandonment to the loud, percussive music of tympanon, castanets, clashing cymbals and flutes, and to the frenzied "Phrygian dancing", perhaps a form of circle-dancing by women, to the roar of "wise and healing music of the gods".
She was partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess Gaia, her Minoan equivalent Rhea, and the Harvest-Mother goddess Demeter.
Once arrived in Italy, these ships have served their purpose and are transformed into sea nymphs.
Modern scholarship remarks that as Cybele's Leo rises above the horizon, Taurus (the Bull) sets; the lion thus dominates the bull.
Claudia Quinta's role as Rome's ''castissima femina'' (purest or most virtuous woman) became "increasingly glorified and fantastic"; she was shown in the costume of a Vestal Virgin, and probably had a cult of her own.
The Taurobolium sacrificed a bull, the most potent and costly victim in Roman religion; the Criobolium used a lesser victim, usually a ram.
She is ancient Phrygia's only known goddess, and was probably the highest deity of the Phrygian State.
The Phrygian character of the cult would have appealed to the Julio-Claudians as an expression of their claim to Trojan ancestry.
Herodotus says that when Anacharsis returned to Scythia after traveling and acquiring knowledge among the Greeks in the 6th century BCE, his brother, the Scythian king, put him to death for joining the cult.
* March 22: ''Arbor intrat'' ("The Tree enters"), commemorating the death of Attis under a pine tree.
Others note that Rome was well versed in the adoption (or sometimes, the "calling forth", or seizure) of foreign deities, and the diplomats who negotiated Cybele's move to Rome would have been well-educated, and well-informed.
At the same time, her power "transcended any purely political usage and spoke directly to the goddess' followers from all walks of life".
A  Hellenistic poet refers to Cybele's priests in the feminine, as ''Gallai''.
Walter Burkert places her among the "foreign gods" of Greek religion, a complex figure combining the Minoan-Mycenaean tradition with the Phrygian cult imported directly from Asia Minor.
The Roman Senate and its religious advisers consulted the Sibylline oracle and decided that Carthage might be defeated if Rome imported the ''Magna Mater'' ("Great Mother") of Phrygian Pessinos.
Ground preparations for the building of St Peters' basilica on the Vatican Hill uncovered a shrine, known as the Phrygianum, with some 24 dedications to Magna Mater and Attis.
Before him stands a Phrygian goddess (identified by the inscription as Agdistis) who carries a tympanon in her left hand.
Some dedications transfer the regenerative power of the sacrifice to non-participants, including emperors, the Imperial family and the Roman state; some mark a ''dies natalis'' (birthday or anniversary) for the participant or recipient.
In Greek myth, a connection between Cybele and Dionysus may not date any earlier than the 1st century BCE: in the ''Bibliotheca'' formerly attributed to Apollodorus, Cybele is said to have cured Dionysus of his madness.
The Roman poet Catullus refers to Attis in the masculine until his emasculation, and in the feminine thereafter.
At the cusp of Rome's transition to Empire, the Greek Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes this procession as wild Phrygian "mummery" and "fabulous clap-trap", in contrast to the Megalesian sacrifices and games, carried out in what he admires as a dignified "traditional Roman" manner; Dionysius also applauds the wisdom of Roman religious law, which wisely forbids the participation of any Roman citizen in the procession, and in the goddess's  mysteries; Slaves are forbidden to witness any of this.
A late, melodramatic and antagonistic account by the Christian apologist Prudentius has a priest stand in a pit beneath a slatted wooden floor; his assistants or junior priests dispatch a bull, using a sacred spear.
At Pessinos in Phrygia, the mother goddess—identified by the Greeks as Cybele—took the form of an unshaped stone of black meteoric iron, and may have been associated with or identical to  Agdistis, Pessinos' mountain deity.
The scene probably represents a ''sellisternium'', a form of banquet usually reserved for goddesses, in accordance with "Greek rite" as practiced in Rome.
Some Galli devoted themselves to their goddess for most of their lives, maintained relationships with relatives and partners throughout, and eventually retired from service.
Romans believed that Cybele, considered a Phrygian outsider even within her Greek cults, was the mother-goddess of ancient Troy (Illium).
For Lucretius, Magna Mater "symbolised the world order".
Augustus selected priests from among his own freedmen to supervise Magna Mater's cult, and brought it under Imperial control.
No contemporary text or myth survives to attest the original character and nature of Cybele's Phrygian cult.
Taurobolium dedications to Magna Mater tend to be more common in the Empire's western provinces than elsewhere, attested by inscriptions in (among others) Rome and Ostia in Italy, Lugdunum in Gaul, and Carthage, in Africa.
Her cults most often were funded privately, rather than by the polis, and her "vivid and forceful character" and association with the wild set her apart from the Olympian gods.
Some of Rome's leading patrician families claimed Trojan ancestry; so the "return" of the Mother of all Gods to her once-exiled people would have been particularly welcome, even if her spouse and priesthood were not; its accomplishment would have reflected well on the principals involved and, in turn, on their descendants.
Some decades after Christianity became the sole Imperial religion, St Augustine saw Galli "parading though the squares and streets of Carthage, with oiled hair and powdered faces, languid limbs and feminine gait, demanding even from the tradespeople the means of continuing to live in disgrace".
In Rome, Cybele was known as Magna Mater ("Great Mother").
Pessinos' stone was later used as the face of the goddess' statue.
In Phrygia, "Attis" was both a commonplace and priestly name, found alike in casual graffiti, the dedications of personal monuments and several of Cybele's Phrygian shrines and monuments.
In contrast to her public role as a protector of cities, Cybele was also the focus of mystery cult, private rites with a chthonic aspect connected to hero cult and exclusive to those who had undergone initiation, though it is unclear who Cybele's initiates were.
Cybele's major mythographic narratives attach to her relationship with Attis, who is described by ancient Greek and Roman sources and cults as her youthful consort, and as a Phrygian deity.
Most modern scholarship agrees that Cybele's consort (Attis) and her eunuch Phrygian priests (Galli) would have arrived with the goddess, along with at least some of the wild, ecstatic features of her Greek and Phrygian cults.
From at least 139 CE, Rome's port at Ostia, the site of the goddess's arrival, had a fully developed sanctuary to Magna Mater and Attis, served by a local Archigallus and college of ''dendrophores'' (the ritual tree-bearers of "Holy Week").
Imperial Magna Mater protected the empire's cities and agriculture &mdash; Ovid "stresses the barrenness of the earth before the Mother's arrival.
The first temple was damaged by fire in 111 BCE, and was repaired or rebuilt.
Claudius promoted Attis to the Roman pantheon and placed his cult under the supervision of the quindecimviri (one of Rome's priestly colleges).
This was believed to be the oldest image of the goddess, and was attributed to the legendary Broteas.
With Rome's eventual hegemony over the Mediterranean world, Romanised forms of Cybele's cults spread throughout the Roman Empire.
As with other deities viewed as foreign introductions, the spread of Cybele's cult was attended by conflict and crisis.
The Roman State adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline oracle recommended her conscription as a key religious component in Rome's second war against Carthage.
The Galli's voluntary emasculation in service of the goddess was thought to give them powers of prophecy.
She is Phrygia's only known goddess, and was probably its state deity.
Augustan ideology identified Magna Mater with Imperial order and Rome's religious authority throughout the empire.
Over time, her Phrygian cults and iconography were transformed, and eventually subsumed, by the influences and interpretations of her foreign devotees, at first Greek and later Roman.
* March 24: ''Sanguem'' or ''Dies Sanguinis'' ("Day of Blood"), a frenzy of mourning when the devotees whipped themselves to sprinkle the altars and effigy of Attis with their own blood; some performed the self-castrations of the Galli.
Galli remained a presence in Roman cities well into the Empire's Christian era.
The sheer expense of the Taurobolium ensured that its initiates were from Rome's highest class, and even the lesser offering of a Criobolium would have been beyond the means of the poor.
"Attis" may have been a name or title of Cybele's priests or priest-kings in ancient Phrygia.
The full sequence at any rate is thought to have been official in the time of Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161), but among extant ''fasti'' appears only in the Calendar of Philocalus (354 CE).
As eunuchs, incapable of reproduction, the Galli were forbidden Roman citizenship and rights of inheritance; like their eastern counterparts, they were technically mendicants whose living depended on the pious generosity of others.
* March 23: on the Tubilustrium, an archaic holiday to Mars, the tree was laid to rest at the temple of the Magna Mater, with the traditional beating of the shields by Mars' priests the Salii and the lustration of the trumpets perhaps assimilated to the noisy music of the Corybantes.
A long, flowing chiton covers her shoulders and back.
Near Setif (Mauretania), the ''dendrophores'' and the faithful (''religiosi'') restored their temple of Cybele and Attis after a disastrous fire in 288 CE.
* March 27: ''Lavatio'' ("Washing"), noted by Ovid and probably an innovation under Augustus, when Cybele's sacred stone was taken in procession from the Palatine temple to the Porta Capena and down the Appian Way to the stream called Almo, a tributary of the Tiber.
Her association with hawks, lions, and the stone of the mountainous landscape of the Anatolian wilderness, seem to characterise her as mother of the land in its untrammeled natural state, with power to rule, moderate or soften its latent ferocity, and to control its potential threats to a settled, civilised life.
Augustus claimed a Trojan ancestry through his adoption by Julius Caesar and the divine favour of Venus; in the iconography of Imperial cult, the empress Livia was Magna Mater's earthly equivalent, Rome's protector and symbolic "Great Mother"; the goddess is portrayed with Livia's face on cameos and statuary.
It burnt down in the early Imperial era, and was restored by Augustus; it burned down again soon after, and Augustus rebuilt it in more sumptuous style; the Ara Pietatis relief shows its pediment.
Scholars are divided as to whether the entire series was more or less put into place under Claudius, or whether the festival grew over time.
The priest emerges from the pit, drenched with the bulls blood, to the applause of the gathered spectators.
This account might attempt to explain the nature, origin and structure of Pessinus' theocracy.
The upper classes who sponsored the Magna Mater's festivals delegated their organisation to the plebeian aediles, and honoured her and each other with lavish, private festival banquets from which her Galli would have been conspicuously absent.
He would have cut a remarkable figure, with "colourful attire and headdress, like a crown, with regal associations unwelcome to the Romans".
Rome officially adopted her cult during the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BCE), after dire prodigies, including a meteor shower, a failed harvest and famine, seemed to warn of Rome's imminent defeat.
It showed her enthroned, with a lion attendant, and a ''tympanon'', the hand drum that was a Greek introduction to her cult and a salient feature in its later developments.
Augustan ideology represented her as the ideal of virtuous Roman womanhood.
This feast was probably held within the building, with attendance reserved for the aristocratic sponsors of the goddesses rites; the flesh of her sacrificial animal provided their meat.
From the start, they were objects of Roman fascination, scorn and religious awe.
Like Dionysus, Cybele was regarded as having a distinctly un-Hellenic temperament, simultaneously embraced and "held at arm's length" by the Greeks.
Magna Mater's temple stood high on the slope of the Palatine, overlooking the valley of the Circus Maximus and facing the temple of Ceres on the slopes of the Aventine.
On April 10, her image was taken in public procession to the Circus Maximus, and chariot races were held there in her honour; a statue of Magna Mater was permanently sited on the racetrack's dividing barrier, showing the goddess seated on a lion's back.
The ''quindecimviri'' attended.
As this cult object belonged to a Roman ally, the Kingdom of Pergamum, the Roman Senate sent ambassadors to seek the king's consent; en route, a consultation with the Greek oracle at Delphi confirmed that the goddess should be brought to Rome.
She gives the Trojans her sacred tree for shipbuilding, and begs Jupiter to make the ships indestructible.
Pessinus, site of the temple whence the Magna Mater was brought to Rome, was a theocracy whose leading Galli may have been appointed via some form of adoption, to ensure "dynastic" succession.
Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine Phrygian castrate shepherd-consort Attis, who was probably a Greek invention.
The Taurobolium and Criobolium are not tied to any particular date or festival, but probably draw on the same theological principles as the life, death and rebirth cycle of the March "holy week".
She herself is uncreated, and thus essentially separate from and independent of her creations.
Yet the senate supported him; and when a plebeian tribune who had violently opposed his right to address the senate died of a fever (or, in the alternative scenario, when the prophesied Roman victory came) Magna Mater's power seemed proven.
In the early Imperial era, the Roman poet Manilius inserts Cybele as the thirteenth deity of an otherwise symmetrical, classic Greco-Roman zodiac, in which each of twelve zodiacal houses (represented by particular constellations) is ruled by one of twelve deities, known in Greece as the Twelve Olympians and in Rome as the Di Consentes.
In the 2nd century CE, the geographer Pausanias attests to a Magnesian (Lydian) cult to "the Mother of the Gods", whose image was carved into a rock-spur of Mount Sipylus.
After Alexander the Great's conquests, "wandering devotees of the goddess became an increasingly common presence in Greek literature and social life; depictions of Attis have been found at numerous Greek sites".
Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, supposedly the "best man" in Rome, was chosen to meet the goddess at Ostia; and Rome's most virtuous matrons (including Claudia Quinta) conducted her to the temple of Victoria, to await the completion of her temple on the Palatine Hill.
Dedicants and participants could be male or female.
Rome's strictures against castration and citizen participation in Magna Mater's cult limited both the number and kind of her initiates.
In the late republican era, Lucretius vividly describes the procession's armed "war dancers" in their three-plumed helmets, clashing their shields together, bronze on bronze, "delighted by blood"; yellow-robed, long-haired, perfumed Galli waving their knives, wild music of thrumming tympanons and shrill flutes.
Claudius introduced the senior priestly office of Archigallus, who was not eunuch and held full Roman citizenship.
The meaning and morality of her cults and priesthoods were topics of debate and dispute in Greek and Roman literature, and remain so in modern scholarship.
Her image held aloft signifies the Earth, which "hangs in the air".
She stands alone within a naiskos, which represents her temple or its doorway, and is crowned with a ''polos'', a high, cylindrical hat.
The account may have been a later invention to explain why a public building was dedicated to an imported deity, as the earliest source is the ''Hymn To The Mother Of The Gods''  (362 CE) by the Roman emperor Julian.
This connection is very likely in Phrygia, and possible in northern Anatolia, where cult to Cybele in Lydia may have connections to the semi-legendary king Midas, as sponsor of her cult, a co-divinity upon his death, a demigod, or her consort.
When shown with Cybele, he is always the younger, lesser deity, or perhaps her priestly attendant; the difference is one of relative degree, rather than essence, as priests were sacred in their own right and were closely identified with their gods.
Virgil's ''Aeneid'' (written between 29 and 19 BCE) embellishes her "Trojan" features; she is ''Berecyntian Cybele'', mother of Jupiter himself, and protector of the Trojan prince Aeneas in his flight from the destruction of Troy.
The histories of her arrival deal with the piety, purity and status of the Romans involved, the success of their religious stratagem, and power of the goddess herself; she has no consort or priesthood, and seems fully Romanised from the first.
It may be that  Claudius established observances mourning the death of Attis, before he had acquired his full significance as a resurrected god of rebirth, expressed by rejoicing at the later ''Canna intrat'' and by the Hilaria.
For the Greeks, the tympanon was a marker of foreign cults, suitable for rites to Cybele, her close equivalent Rhea, and Dionysus; of these, only Cybele holds the tympanon herself.
In Greece, Cybele is associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions.
Cybele drew ire from Christians throughout the Empire; when St. Theodore of Amasea was granted time to recant his beliefs, he spent it by burning a temple of Cybele instead.
The ''dendrophores'' ("tree bearers") cut down a tree, suspended from it an image of Attis, and carried it to the temple with lamentations.
Reliefs show her alongside young female and male attendants with torches, and vessels for purification.
From the 160's CE, citizens who sought initiation to her mysteries could offer either of two forms of bloody animal sacrifice - and sometimes both - as lawful substitutes for self-castration.
The "sacred night" followed, with Attis placed in his ritual tomb.
* March 28: ''Initium Caiani'', sometimes interpreted as initiations into the mysteries of the Magna Mater and Attis at the Gaianum, near the Phrygianum sanctuary at the Vatican Hill.
The festival structure is unclear, but it included ludi scaenici (plays and other entertainments based on religious themes), probably performed on the deeply stepped approach to her temple; some of the plays were commissioned from well-known playwrights.
With her right, she hands him a jug, as if to welcome him into her cult with a share of her own libation.
She is the mother of all, and the yoked lions that draw her chariot show the offspring's duty of obedience to the parent.
Her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies around the 6th century BCE.
For a few days of the year, during the Megalesia, Cybele's laws allowed them to leave their quarters, located within the goddess' temple complex, and roam the streets to beg for money.
There the stone and sacred iron implements were bathed "in the Phrygian manner" by a red-robed priest.
His earliest certain image as deity appears on a 4th-century BCE Greek stele from Piraeus, near Athens, shows him as the Hellenised stereotype of a rustic, eastern barbarian; he sits at ease, sporting the Phrygian cap and shepherd's crook of his later Greek and Roman cults.
The inscription ''Matar Kubileya'' at a Phrygian rock-cut shrine, dated to the first half of the 6th century BCE, is usually read as "Mother of the mountain", a reading supported by ancient Classical sources, and consistent with Cybele as any of several similar tutelary goddesses, each known as "mother" and associated with specific Anatolian mountains or other localities: a goddess thus "born from stone".
Many are now lost, but most that survive were dedicated by high-status Romans after a taurobolium sacrifice to Magna Mater.
The gigantic remains of such a figure at Mount Sipylus, though lacking inscriptions and much eroded, are consistent with later representations of a seated Cybele, with a supporting or attendant lion beneath each arm.
In Athenian tradition, the city's metroon was founded around 500 BCE to placate Cybele, who had visited a plague on Athens when one of her wandering priests was killed for his attempt to introduce her cult.
The following year, perhaps in response to this gesture of goodwill, the Roman senate formally recognised Illium as the ancestral home of the Roman people, granting it extra territory and tax immunity.
On the cuirass of Augustus' Prima Porta statue, Magna Mater's tympanon lies at the feet of the goddess Tellus.
From around the 6th century BCE, cults to the Anatolian mother-goddess were introduced from Phrygia into the ethnically Greek colonies of western Anatolia, mainland Greece, the Aegean islands and the westerly colonies of Magna Graecia.
The return trip was made by torchlight, with much rejoicing.
The ceremony alluded to, but did not reenact, Cybele's original reception in the city, and seems not to have involved Attis.
The goddess arrived in Rome in the form of Pessinos' black meteoric stone.
No Roman, not even a slave, could castrate themselves "in honour of the Goddess" without penalty; in 101 BCE, a slave who had done so was exiled.
Damascius attributed a "liberation from Hades" to the Hilaria.
The festival date coincided, more or less, with events of the Roman agricultural calendar (around April 12) when farmers were advised to dig their vineyards, break up the soil, sow millet "and - curiously apposite, given the nature of the Mother's priests - castrate cattle and other animals."
The Roman display of Cybele's Megalesia procession as an exotic, privileged public pageant offers signal contrast to what is known of the private, socially inclusive Phrygian-Greek mysteries on which it was based.
Manilius has Cybele and Jupiter as co-rulers of Leo (the Lion), in astrological opposition to Juno, who rules Aquarius.
Roman bystanders seem to have perceived Megalesia as either characteristically "Greek"; or Phrygian.
Some modern scholars assume that Attis must have followed much later; or that the Galli, described in later sources as shockingly effeminate and flamboyantly "unRoman", must have been an unexpected consequence of bringing the goddess in blind obedience to the Sibyl; a case of "biting off more than one can chew".
In Phrygian art of the 8th century BCE, the cult attributes of the Phrygian mother-goddess include attendant lions, a bird of prey, and a small vase for her libations or other offerings.
It was accessible via a long upward flight of steps from a flattened area or proscenium below, where the goddess's festival games and plays were staged.
Some of the possible Greek models for Cybele's Megalensia festival include representations of lions attacking and dominating bulls.
In 103, a Battakes traveled to Rome and addressed its senate, either for the redress of impieties committed at his shrine, or to predict yet another Roman military success.
To show her role as protector of cities, or city states, she was sometimes shown wearing a Mural Crown, representing the city walls.
She was readily assimilated to the Minoan-Greek earth-mother Rhea, "Mother of the gods", whose raucous, ecstatic rites she may have acquired.
The celebrant personally and symbolically took the place of Attis, and like him was cleansed, renewed or, in emerging from the pit or tomb, "reborn" These regenerative effects were thought to fade over time, but they could be renewed by further sacrifice.
A three-day period of mourning followed.
They include the armed Kouretes, who danced around Zeus and clashed their shields to amuse him; their supposedly Phrygian equivalents, the youthful Corybantes, who provided similarly wild and martial music, dance and song; and the dactyls and Telchines, magicians associated with metalworking.
Some early Christian sources associate this day with the resurrection of Jesus.
By this time, Rome had absorbed the goddess's Greek and Phrygian homelands, and the Roman version of Cybele as Imperial Rome's protector was introduced there.
They were outsiders, marked out as Galli by their regalia, and their notoriously effeminate dress and demeanour, but as priests of a state cult, they were sacred and inviolate.
The goddess's image, wearing the Mural Crown and seated within a sculpted, lion-drawn chariot, is carried high on a bier.
The goddess is represented by her empty throne and crown, flanked by two figures of Attis reclining on tympanons; and by two lions who eat from bowls, as if tamed by her unseen presence.
Their cults, however shared several characteristics: the foreigner-deity arrived in a chariot, drawn by exotic big cats (Dionysus by tigers, Cybele by lions), accompanied by wild music and an ecstatic entourage of exotic foreigners and people from the lower classes.
In due course, the famine ended and Hannibal was defeated.
Lavish new fittings paid for by the private group included the silver statue of Cybele and her processional chariot; the latter received a new canopy with tassels in the form of fir cones.
Rome seems to have introduced evergreen cones (pine or fir) to Cybele's iconography, based at least partly on Rome's "Trojan ancestor" myth, in which the goddess gave Aeneas her sacred tree for shipbuilding.
The Galli themselves, though imported to serve the day-to-day workings of their goddess's cult on Rome's behalf, represented an inversion of Roman priestly traditions in which senior priests were citizens, expected to raise families, and personally responsible for the running costs of their temples, assistants, cults and festivals.
Some Phrygian shaft monuments are thought to have been used for libations and blood offerings to Cybele, perhaps anticipating by several centuries the pit used in her Taurobolium and Criobolium sacrifices during the Roman Imperial era.
The highest ranking Gallus was known as "Attis", and his junior as "Battakes".
In the religious revivalism of the later Imperial era, Magna Mater's notable initiates included the deeply religious, wealthy and erudite  praetorian prefect Praetextatus;  the  quindecimvir Volusianus, who was twice consul; and possibly the Emperor Julian.
This corpulent, fertile Mother Goddess appears to be giving birth on her throne, which has two feline-headed hand rests.
This description of a Taurobolium as blood-bath is, if accurate, an exception to usual Roman sacrificial practice; it may have been no more than a bull sacrifice in which the blood was carefully collected and offered to the deity, along with its organs of generation, the testicles.
The day was formalized as part of the official Roman calendar under Claudius.
The religiously lawful circumstances for a Gallus's self-castration remain unclear; some may have performed the operation on the Dies Sanguinis ("Day of Blood") in Cybele and Attis' March festival.
Romans knew Cybele as ''Magna Mater'' ("Great Mother"), or as ''Magna Mater deorum Idaea'' ("great Idaean mother of the gods"), equivalent to the Greek title ''Meter Theon Idaia'' ("Mother of the Gods, from Mount Ida").
Attis seems to have accompanied the diffusion of Cybele's cult through Magna Graecia; there is evidence of their joint cult at the Greek colonies of Marseilles (Gaul) and Lokroi (southern Italy) from the 6th and 7th centuries BCE.
In the mid 2nd century, letters from the king of Pergamum to Cybele's shrine at Pessinos consistently address its chief priest as "Attis".
She was promoted as patrician property; a Roman matron &ndash; albeit a strange one, "with a stone for a face" &ndash; who acted for the clear benefit of the Roman state.
None of these dedicants were priests of the Magna Mater or Attis, and several held priesthoods of one or more different cults.
She is sometimes shown with lion attendants.
In Greece, as in Phrygia, she was a "Mistress of animals" ''(Potnia Therōn)'', with her mastery of the natural world expressed by the lions that flank her, sit in her lap or draw her chariot.
Stories of Magna Mater's arrival were used to promote the fame of its principals, and thus their descendants.
Roman legend connects this voyage, or its end, to the matron Claudia Quinta, who was accused of inchastity but proved her innocence with a miraculous feat on behalf of the goddess.
Uniquely in Greek religion, she had a transgender or eunuch mendicant priesthood.
The goddess herself was contained within her Palatine precinct, along with her priesthood, at the geographical heart of Rome's most ancient religious traditions.
The emperor Claudius claimed her among his ancestors.
His divinity may therefore have begun as a Greek invention based on what was known of Cybele's Phrygian cult.
Significant anniversaries, stations and participants in the goddess' 204 arrival - including her ship, which would have been thought a sacred object - may have been marked from the beginning by minor, local or private rites and festivals at Ostia, Rome, and Victoria's temple.
In Rome, the Galli and their cult fell under the supreme authority of the pontifices, who were usually drawn from Rome's highest ranking, wealthiest citizens.
Various Roman sources refer to the Galli as a middle or third gender (''medium genus'' or ''tertium sexus'').
The evergreen cones probably originated as symbols of Attis's death and rebirth  but despite the archaeological evidence of his early cult at Cybele's Palatine temple precinct, no surviving Roman literary or epigraphic source mentions his name until Catullus's  poem 63 places him squarely within Magna Mater's mythology, as the hapless leader and prototype of her Galli.
The ''Megalesia'' festival to Magna Mater commenced on April 4, the anniversary of her arrival in Rome.
* March 26: ''Requietio'' ("Day of Rest").
At the top of the steps was a statue of the enthroned goddess, wearing a mural crown and attended by lions.
Images and iconography in funerary contexts, and the ubiquity of her Phrygian name ''Matar'' ("Mother"), suggest that she was a mediator between the "boundaries of the known and unknown": the civilised and the wild, the worlds of the living and the dead.
The Galli of Pessinus were politically influential; in 189 BC, they predicted or prayed for Roman victory in Rome's imminent war against the Galatians.
Most myths of the deified Attis present him as founder of Cybele's Galli priesthood but in Servius' account, written during the Roman Imperial era, Attis castrates a king to escape his unwanted sexual attentions, and is castrated in turn by the dying king.
Conflation with Rhea led to Cybele's association with various male demigods who served Rhea as attendants, or as guardians of her son, the infant Zeus, as he lay in the cave of his birth.
Cybele's priests find Attis at the base of a pine tree; he dies and they bury him, emasculate themselves in his memory, and celebrate him in their rites to the goddess.
Cybele may have evolved from an Anatolian Mother Goddess of a type found at Çatalhöyük, dated to the 6th millennium BCE.
Pliny describes the procedure as relatively safe, but it is not known at what stage in their career the Galli performed it, or exactly what was removed, or even if all Galli performed it.
The Greeks called her ''Mātēr'' or ''Mētēr'' ("Mother"), or from the early 5th century ''Kubelē''; in Pindar, she is "Mistress Cybele the Mother".
Among the Roman masses, there is evidence of private devotion to Attis, but virtually none for initiations to Magna Mater's cult.
'''Cybele''' (; Phrygian: ''Matar Kubileya/Kubeleya'' "''Kubeleyan'' Mother", perhaps "''Mountain'' Mother"; Lydian ''Kuvava'';  ''Kybele'',  ''Kybebe'',  ''Kybelis'') is an  Anatolian mother goddess; she has a possible precursor in the earliest neolithic at Çatalhöyük, where the statue of a pregnant, seated goddess was found in a granary.
By the end of the 1st century BCE, their rites In Athens, and elsewhere, were sometimes combined; Strabo notes that Rhea-Cybele's popular rites in Athens might be held in conjunction with Dionysus' procession.
In Greece, Cybele met with a mixed reception.
Cults to Claudia Quinta are likely, particularly in the Imperial era, as a heroic exemplar of Roman womanhood.
Along the route, rose petals are scattered, and clouds of incense arise.
In cult terms, they seem to have functioned as intercessors or intermediaries between goddess and mortal devotees, through dreams, waking trance or ecstatic dance and song.
These ships become the means of escape for Aeneas and his men, guided towards Italy and a destiny as ancestors of the Roman people by Venus Genetrix.
In Demosthenes' ''On the Crown'' (330 BCE), ''attes'' is "a ritual cry shouted by followers of mystic rites".
Cybele's early Greek images are small votive representations of her monumental rock-cut images in the Phrygian highlands.
