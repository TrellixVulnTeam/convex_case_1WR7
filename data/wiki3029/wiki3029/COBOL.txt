The COBOL specification was revised three times in the five years after its publication.
COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs.
Some vendors (including Micro Focus, Fujitsu, and IBM) introduced object-oriented syntax based on drafts of the full revision.
A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000.
In the above fragment, the ELSE associates with the &nbsp;&nbsp; statement instead of the &nbsp;&nbsp; statement, causing a bug.
Explicit file structure definitions preceded the development of database management systems and aggregated data was a significant advance over Fortran's arrays.
A  (or ) clause is a string of characters, each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain.

The name "COBOL" was suggested by Bob Bemer.
For example, a condition can be expressed as &nbsp; or more concisely as &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;.
However, some committee members raised concerns about incompatibilities between implementations and frequent modifications of the standard.
The language's stated objectives were to allow efficient, portable programs to be easily written, to allow users to move to new systems with minimal effort and cost, and to be suitable for inexperienced programmers.
The CODASYL Executive Committee later created the COBOL Maintenance Committee to answer questions from users and vendors and to improve and expand the specifications.

On the other hand, conversion to COBOL-85 was thought to increase productivity in future years, thus justifying the conversion costs.
Proponents say that this was intended to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance.

Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming.
In 2006 and 2012, ''Computerworld'' surveys found that over 60% of organizations used COBOL (more than C++ and Visual Basic .NET) and that for half of those, COBOL was used for the majority of their internal software.

COBOL 2002 was five years late,
The vice-president, William Rinehuls, complained that two-thirds of the COBOL community did not know of the committee's existence.

Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.
It soon became apparent that the committee was too large for any further progress to be made quickly.

s were largely replaced by the  statement and procedures, which promoted modular programming and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities.
A 77 level-number indicates the item is stand-alone, and in such situations is equivalent to the level-number 01.
The original (1959) COBOL specification supported the infamous &nbsp;&nbsp; statement, for which many compilers generated self-modifying code.
At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.
ANSI produced ''USA Standard COBOL X3.23'' in August 1968, which became the cornerstone for later versions.
COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use, while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.
They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.
Representatives included Grace Hopper, inventor of the English-like data processing language FLOW-MATIC, Jean Sammet and Saul Gorn.

Classes have factory objects, containing class methods and variables, and instance objects, containing instance methods and variables.
A sub-committee was formed to analyze existing languages and was made up of six individuals:
A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.
The desire for readability led to the use of English-like syntax and structural elements, such as nouns, verbs, clauses, sentences, sections, and divisions.

Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory.
Yet by 1984, maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with "incomprehensible" code and the main changes in COBOL-85 were there to help ease maintenance.
At a mid-September meeting, the committee discussed the new language's name.
(This syntax is similar to the "dot notation" supported by most contemporary languages.)
However,  could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used, making programs harder to understand.
However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words.
The mine is then triggered upon reaching the end of  and means control could return to one of two locations:
Specifically, mines occur when execution of a range of procedures would cause control flow to go past the last statement of a range of procedures already being performed.
COBOL was intended to be a highly portable, "common" language.

'''COBOL''' (, an acronym for ''common business-oriented language'') is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use.
The same poll also found that only 25% of academics had COBOL programming on their curriculum even though 60% thought they should teach it.

COBOL 2002 also introduced free-format code.
The first COBOL program ran on 17 August on an RCA 501.
In late 1962, IBM announced that COBOL would be their primary development language and that development of COMTRAN would cease.
Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis, physics and system programming than the commercial file-processing problems which COBOL development tackled.
But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages.

The short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies.
On December 6 and 7, the same COBOL program (albeit with minor changes) ran on an RCA computer and a Remington-Rand Univac computer, demonstrating that compatibility could be achieved.
Four statements control the report writer: , which prepares the report writer for printing; , which prints a report group; , which suppresses the printing of a report group; and , which terminates report processing.
FLOW-MATIC's major contributions to COBOL were long variable names, English words for commands and the separation of data descriptions and instructions.

Near the end of the 20th century, the year 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of significant COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before.
COBOL 2002 suffered from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard.

Nevertheless, much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, which has become unmaintainable.
The delegation impressed Charles A. Phillips, director of the Data System Research Staff at the DoD, who thought that they "thoroughly understood" the DoD's problems.
Data items in COBOL are declared hierarchically through the use of level-numbers which indicate if a data item is part of another.
Two amendments followed in 1989 and 1993, the first introducing intrinsic functions and the other providing corrections.
Academic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for businessmen, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.
Later that year, the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) said it was "strongly opposed" to the new standard, citing "prohibitive" conversion costs and enhancements that were "forced on the user".

Subordinate items can be disambiguated with the  (or ) keyword.
Each division is sub-divided into sections, which are made up of paragraphs.
Donald Nelson, chair of the CODASYL COBOL committee, said in 1984 that "academics ... hate COBOL" and that computer science graduates "had 'hate COBOL' drilled into them".
Features from COMTRAN incorporated into COBOL included formulas, the  clause, an improved IF statement, which obviated the need for GO TOs, and a more robust file management system.
FLOW-MATIC's inventor, Grace Hopper, also served as a technical adviser to the committee.
Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value; for example, when creating a report detailing customers' orders, a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer's orders.
In 1980, Grace Hopper commented that "COBOL 60 is 95% FLOW-MATIC" and that COMTRAN had had an "extremely small" influence.

Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson's sales and which warns of any invalid records:
Furthermore, she said that she would claim that work was influenced by both FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN only to "keep other people happy so they wouldn't try to knock us out".

Some of its features were not incorporated into COBOL so that it would not look like IBM had dominated the design process, and Jean Sammet said in 1981 that there had been a "strong anti-IBM bias" from some committee members (herself included).
Representatives enthusiastically described a language that could work in a wide variety of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control.

Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.
Later, COBOL suffered from a shortage of material covering it; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear (with Richard D. Irwin publishing a college textbook on COBOL in 1966).
By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (Bendix, Control Data Corporation, General Electric (GE), National Cash Register and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers.
For example, the following code defines two 88-level condition-name items that are true or false depending on the current character data value of the  data item.
The meeting resulted in the creation of a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees.
The specifications were presented to the Executive Committee on September 4.

For example, a series of  characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a  to the left of this position will contain a space.
This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records.
The second public review drew another 1,000 (mainly negative) responses, while the last drew just 25, by which time many concerns had been addressed.
FORTRAN, the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.
