However, both methods were found to be relatively inefficient treatment options, mainly because very few cells take up the vector and express the gene, so the treatment has little effect.
* Diarrhea: The prevalence of CF in Europe might be connected with the development of cattle domestication.
* Cholera: With the discovery that cholera toxin requires normal host CFTR proteins to function properly, it was hypothesized that carriers of mutant ''CFTR'' genes benefited from resistance to cholera and other causes of diarrhea.
Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung might contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung.
To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.
Once within the lungs, these bacteria adapt to the environment and develop resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
Further studies have not confirmed this hypothesis.
One approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the stop codon and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein.
As lung disease worsens, mechanical breathing support may become necessary.
This condition, called meconium ileus, occurs in 5–10% of newborns with CF.
The accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs allows bacteria to hide from the body's immune system, causing repeated respiratory infections.
