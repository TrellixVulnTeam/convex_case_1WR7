"'''Prometheus'''" is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in which a character based on the mythic Prometheus addresses God (as Zeus) in a romantic and misotheist tone of accusation and defiance.
The Greek origins of the Prometheus myth have already discussed the ''Titanomachia'' as placing the cosmic struggle of Olympus at some point in time preceding the creation of humanity, while in the New Testament synthesis there was a strong assimilation of the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew prophets and their strongly eschatological orientation.
Ancient myths and legends relate at least four versions of the narratives describing Prometheus, his exploits with Zeus, and his eternal punishment as also inflicted by Zeus.
The two remaining central episodes regarding Prometheus as written by Hesiod include his theft of fire from Olympus for the benefit of humanity against the will of Zeus, and the eternal punishment which Prometheus would endure for these acts as inflicted upon him by the judgment of Zeus.
This can be found upon a sarcophagus of the Church at Mas d'Aire as well, and in an even more direct comparison to what Raggio refers to as "a coursely carved relief from Campli (Teramo) (where) the Lord sits on a throne and models the body of Adam, exactly like Prometheus."
They are used by Homer to designate an unlimited, violent insolence among the warring Titans which only Zeus was able to ultimately overcome.
Raggio summarizes the Munich version as follows; "The Munich panel represents the dispute between Epimetheus and Prometheus, the handsome triumphant statue of the new man, modeled by Prometheus, his ascension to the sky under the guidance of Minerva; the Strasburg panel shows in the distance Prometheus lighting his torch at the wheels of the Sun, and in the foreground on one side, Prometheus applying his torch to the heart of the statue and , on the other, Mercury fastening him to a tree."
Prometheus, himself a Titan, managed to avoid being in the direct confrontational cosmic battle between Zeus and the other Olympians against Cronus and the other Titans.
The four most ancient historical sources for the Prometheus myth are Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, and Pythagoras.
It was first published fifteen years later in 1789.
There is a single somewhat comprehensive version of the birth of Prometheus and several variant versions of his subjection to eternal suffering at the will of Zeus.
In this version of the myth, the use of fire was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.
For Campbell, Jesus mortally suffered on the Cross while Prometheus eternally suffered while chained to a rock, and each of them received punishment for the gift which they bestowed to humankind, for Jesus this was the gift of propitiation from Heaven, and, for Prometheus this was the gift of fire from Olympus.
According to these sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.
Using a similar interpretation to that of Boccaccio, Marsilio Ficino in the fifteenth century updated the philosophical and more somber reception of the Prometheus myth not seen since the time of Plotinus.
A 2012 three-part essay on the science fiction film titled Prometheus identified the eight key themes in understanding the film, with only “Parental Issues” appearing to have a solid connection to the myth of Prometheus.
For Lynch, modern scholarship is hampered by not having the full trilogy of Prometheus by Aeschylus, the last two parts of which have been lost to antiquity.

All the details are evidently borrowed from Boccaccio's ''Genealogiae''.
Not only does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but "the means of life," as well (42).
Both Argos and Opous claimed to be Prometheus' final resting place, each erecting a tomb in his honor.
This eschatological and apocalyptic setting of a Last Judgement is in precise contrast to the ''Titanomachia'' of Hesiod which serves its distinct service to Greek mythology as its ''Prolegomenon'', bracketing all subsequent mythology, including the creation of humanity, as coming after the cosmological struggle between the Titans and the Olympian gods.
The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural acts of reproduction.
Anecdotally, the Roman fabulist Phaedrus (c.15BCE - c.50CE) attributes to Aesop a simple etiology for homosexuality, in Prometheus' getting drunk while creating the first humans and misapplying the genitalia.

For Shakespeare, the allusion is clearly to the interpretation of the fire from the heat as the bestowing of life to the creation of man from clay by Prometheus after it was stolen from Olympus.
The Titan's greatest benefaction for humankind seems to have been saving them from complete destruction.
This somberness of attitude in Ficino's text would be further developed later by Charles de Bouelles' ''Liber de Sapiente'' of 1509 which presented a mix of both scholastic and Neoplatonic ideas.
Although Bloom is least interested in the first two schools, the second one on the Christian orthodox has special bearing on the reception of the Prometheus myth during late Roman antiquity and the synthesis of the New Testament canon.
It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light ... that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and ... only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge."
In the Book of Job, significant comparisons can be drawn between the sustained suffering of Job in comparison to that of eternal suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth.
The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.There remains the inexplicable mass of rock.
Lynch's general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod.
With this change from the traditional lineage the poet distinguished his hero from the race of the Titans."
This contrast placed a strong emphasis within the ancient Greek consciousness as to the moral and ontological acceptance of the mythology of the ''Titanomachia'' as an accomplished mythological history, whereas for the synthesis of the New Testament narratives this placed religious consciousness within the community at the level of an anticipated ''eschaton'' not yet accomplished.
''Prometheus Bound'' also includes two mythic innovations of omission.
Alexander Scriabin composed ''Prometheus: Poem of Fire'', Opus 60 (1910), also for orchestra.
The most significant narratives of his origin appear in the ''Theogony'' of Hesiod which relates Prometheus as being the son of the Titan Iapetus by Clymene, one of the Oceanids.
According to the second, Prometheus, goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks, pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it.
This drawing in the Morgan Library is perhaps one of the most intense examples of the visualization of the myth of Prometheus from the Renaissance period.
Despite his importance to the myths and imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of Prometheus during the Archaic and Classical periods seems to have been limited.
With this, Boccaccio shows himself moving from the medieval sources with a shift of accent towards the attitude of the Renaissance humanists.

The Vedic myth of fire's theft by Mātariśvan is an analog to the Greek account.
Following his 1959 book, Bloom edited an anthology of critical opinions on Shelley for Chelsea House Publishers where he concisely stated his opinion as, "Shelley is the unacknowledged ancestor of Wallace Stevens' conception of poetry as the Supreme Fiction, and ''Prometheus Unbound'' is the most capable imagining, outside of Blake and Wordsworth, that the Romantic quest for a Supreme Fiction has achieved."
Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for future sacrifices.
Prometheus, however, stole fire back in a giant fennel-stalk and restored it to humanity.
The intentional use of the German phrase "" ("When I was a child"): the use of '''' is distinctive, and with it Goethe directly applies the Lutheran translation of Saint Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, 13:11: "" ("When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things").

Of the four symbols of suffering associated with Jesus after his trial in Jerusalem (i) the crown of thorns, (ii) the scourge of whips, (iii) the nailing to the Cross, and (iv) the spearing of his side, it is only this last one which bears some resemblance to the eternal suffering of Prometheus' daily torment of an eagle devouring a replenishing organ, his liver, from his side.
In a similar fashion, the origin of the naming of the Titans as a group has been disputed with some voicing a preference for reading it as a combination of ''titainein'' (to exert), and, ''titis'' (retribution) usually rendered as "retribution meted out to the exertion of the Titans."

To the Socratic Greeks, one important aspect of the discussion of religion would correspond to the philosophical discussion of 'becoming' with respect to the New Testament syncretism rather than the ontological discussion of 'being' which was more prominent in the ancient Greek experience of mythologically oriented cult and religion.
Raggio then goes on to point out Plato's distinction of creative power (''techne'') which is presented as superior to merely natural instincts (''physis'').
Significantly, Campbell is also clear to indicate the limits of applying the metaphors of his methodology in his book ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' too closely in assessing the comparison of Prometheus and Jesus.
