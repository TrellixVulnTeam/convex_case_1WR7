Some hatch as apparently miniature adults (direct development), and in some cases, such as silverfish, the hatchlings do not feed and may be helpless until after their first moult.
Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and arachnids.
Two recent hypotheses about the evolution of biomineralization in arthropods and other groups of animals propose that it provides tougher defensive armor, and that it allows animals to grow larger and stronger by providing more rigid skeletons; and in either case a mineral-organic composite exoskeleton is cheaper to build than an all-organic one of comparable strength.
Commercial butterfly breeding provides Lepidoptera stock to butterfly conservatories, educational exhibits
Cooked tarantulas are considered a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela, after the highly irritant hairs&nbsp;– the spider's main defense system&nbsp;– are removed.
This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods.
There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.
The heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel.
For example, they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use feather-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to filter food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick felt-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve as defensive spines.
Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures, excluding most European, Hindu and Islamic cultures.
The joints between body segments and between limb sections are covered by flexible cuticle.
Small arthropods with bivalve-like shells have been found in Early Cambrian fossil beds dating  in China.
It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards.
Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems.
Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is uric acid, which can be excreted as dry material; the Malpighian tubule system filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as feces.
Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.
The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian ''Rhyniognatha hirsti'', dated at , but its mandibles are of a type found only in winged insects, which suggests that the earliest insects appeared in the Silurian period.
The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water.
Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle Cenozoic.
The earliest Cambrian trilobite fossils are about 530 million years old, but the class was already quite diverse and worldwide, suggesting that they had been around for quite some time.
This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and brachiopods in another superphylum, Lophotrochozoa.
The exoskeleton or cuticles consists of chitin, a polymer of glucosamine.
Most arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of compound eyes and pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes").
Humans also unintentionally eat arthropods in other foods, and food safety regulations lay down acceptable contamination levels for different kinds of food material.
Working out the evolutionary stages by which all these different combinations could have appeared is so difficult that it has long been known as "the arthropod head problem".
Crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp and prawns have long been part of human cuisine, and are now raised commercially.
Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic "ladder-like" appearance.
In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors.
As with other invertebrates the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in corpuscles as they are in vertebrates.
The group is generally regarded as monophyletic, and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with cycloneuralians (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum Ecdysozoa.
The oldest known arachnid is the trigonotarbid ''Palaeotarbus jerami'', from about  in the Silurian period.
The eyes are mounted on the acron.
Arthropods provide the earliest identifiable fossils of land animals, from about  in the Late Silurian, and terrestrial tracks from about  appear to have been made by arthropods.
A study in 1992 estimated that there were 500,000 species of animals and plants in Costa Rica alone, of which 365,000 were arthropods.
In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries oxygen to the tissues, while hexapods use a separate system of tracheae.
The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it.
In the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle.
This is due to the census modeling assumptions projected onto other regions in order to scale up from counts at specific locations applied to the whole world.
Chelicerae appear in scorpions and horseshoe crabs as tiny claws that they use in feeding, but those of spiders have developed as fangs that inject venom.
Aquatic arthropods may breed by external fertilization, as for example frogs also do, or by internal fertilization, where the ova remain in the female's body and the sperm must somehow be inserted.
The placement of the extinct trilobites is also a frequent subject of dispute.
Biomineralization generally affects the exocuticle and the outer part of the endocuticle.
The last common ancestor of living arthropods probably consisted of a series of undifferentiated segments, each with a pair of appendages that functioned as limbs.
This Ur-arthropod had a ventral mouth, pre-oral antennae and dorsal eyes at the front of the body.
This phase begins when the epidermis has secreted a new epicuticle to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching.
In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup.
Forensic entomology uses evidence provided by arthropods to establish the time and sometimes the place of death of a human, and in some cases the cause.
Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the segmental ganglia are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front "super-segment").
(2010); traditional subphyla in bold
Arthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.
They are characterised by the presence of chelicerae, appendages just above / in front of the mouth.
Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a coelom, a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs.
The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.
Aside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms, mostly from the Early Cambrian, which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them.
The phylogeny of the major extant arthropod groups has been an area of considerable interest and dispute.
The exoskeleton cannot stretch and thus restricts growth.
Other blood-sucking insects infect livestock with diseases that kill many animals and greatly reduce the usefulness of others.
Their cuticles vary in the details of their structure, but generally consist of three main layers: the epicuticle, a thin outer waxy coat that moisture-proofs the other layers and gives them some protection; the exocuticle, which consists of chitin and chemically hardened proteins; and the endocuticle, which consists of chitin and unhardened proteins.
Because arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators.
Estimates of the number of arthropod species vary between 1,170,000 and 5 to 10&nbsp;million and account for over 80% of all known living animal species.
The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting.
The red dye cochineal, produced from a Central American species of insect, was economically important to the Aztecs and Mayans, and while the region was under Spanish control, becoming Mexico's second most-lucrative export; and it is now regaining some of the ground it lost to synthetic competitors.
These changes made the scope of the term "arthropod" unclear, and Claus Nielsen proposed that the wider group should be labelled "Panarthropoda" ("all the arthropods") while the animals with jointed limbs and hardened cuticles should be called "Euarthropoda" ("true arthropods").
The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is copper-based hemocyanin; this is used by many crustaceans and a few centipedes.
Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of "arthropods" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the chelicerates, including spiders and scorpions; the crustaceans; and the uniramia, consisting of onychophorans, myriapods and hexapods.
Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic ligaments or by small muscles, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall.
Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows.
The cuticle may have setae (bristles) growing from special cells in the epidermis.
Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate.
Re-examination in the 1970s of the Burgess Shale fossils from about  identified many arthropods, some of which could not be assigned to any of the well-known groups, and thus intensified the debate about the Cambrian explosion.
Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods.
The blood of horseshoe crabs contains a clotting agent Limulus Amebocyte Lysate which is now used to test that antibiotics and kidney machines are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.
Arthropods have open circulatory systems, although most have a few short, open-ended arteries.
), Tracheata (arthropods that breathe via channels into their bodies; includes insects and myriapods), and the extinct trilobites&nbsp;– have heads formed of various combinations of segments, with appendages that are missing or specialized in different ways.
Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.
Various touch sensors, mostly setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents.
Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine.
Arthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly as pollinators of crops.
Arthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use internal fertilization, but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection.
The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept.
All known terrestrial arthropods use internal fertilization.
Aquatic species use either internal or external fertilization.
However, the main eyes of spiders are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images, and those of jumping spiders can rotate to track prey.
The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus.
Arthropods also have two body elements that are not part of this serially repeated pattern of segments, an acron at the front, ahead of the mouth, and a telson at the rear, behind the anus.
The exoskeletons of most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.
However, most male terrestrial arthropods produce spermatophores, waterproof packets of sperm, which the females take into their bodies.
# '''Crustaceans''' are primarily aquatic (a notable exception being woodlice) and are characterised by having biramous appendages.
''Attercopus fimbriunguis'', from  in the Devonian period, bears the earliest known silk-producing spigots, but its lack of spinnerets means it was not one of the true spiders, which first appear in the Late Carboniferous over .
For example, Graham Budd's analyses of ''Kerygmachela'' in 1993 and of ''Opabinia'' in 1996 convinced him that these animals were similar to onychophorans and to various Early Cambrian "lobopods", and he presented an "evolutionary family tree" that showed these as "aunts" and "cousins" of all arthropods.
The four major groups of arthropods&nbsp;– Chelicerata (includes spiders and scorpions), Crustacea (shrimps, lobsters, crabs, etc.
It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle.
Living arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of ganglia from which sensory and motor nerves run to other parts of the segment.
Ticks can cause tick paralysis and several parasite-borne diseases in humans.
They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.
However, little is known about what other internal sensors arthropods may have.
Crustaceans commonly hatch as tiny nauplius larvae that have only three segments and pairs of appendages.
Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances.
A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based hemoglobin, the respiratory pigment used by vertebrates.
The earliest fossil crustaceans date from about  in the Cambrian, and fossil shrimp from about  apparently formed a tight-knit procession across the seabed.
Since the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises no priority above the rank of family, many of the higher-level groups can be referred to by a variety of different names.
Most arthropods lay eggs, but scorpions are ovoviparous: they produce live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother, and are noted for prolonged maternal care.
However, individuals of most species remain of one sex their entire lives.
# '''Hexapods''' comprise insects and three small orders of insect-like animals with six thoracic legs.
Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by moulting, or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened.
Relationships of Ecdysozoa to each other and to annelids, etc., including euthycarcinoids
Each body segment and limb section is encased in hardened cuticle.
At this point the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed.
The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages.
They are sometimes grouped with the hexapods.
These arguments usually bypassed trilobites, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear.
By the end of this phase the new endocuticle has formed.
A few arthropods, such as barnacles, are hermaphroditic, that is, each can have the organs of both sexes.
If the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved convergently or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.
Many arachnids have book lungs.
Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments.
From 1952 to 1977, zoologist Sidnie Manton and others argued that arthropods are polyphyletic, in other words, that they do not share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.
Crustacean fossils are common from the Ordovician period onwards.
Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form.
They are sometimes grouped with the myriapods, in a group called Uniramia, though genetic evidence tends to support a closer relationship between hexapods and crustaceans.
# '''Myriapods''' comprise millipedes, centipedes, and their relatives and have many body segments, each bearing one or two pairs of legs.
Arthropods are invertebrates with segmented bodies and jointed limbs.
''Marrella'' was the first one to be recognized as significantly different from the well-known groups.
Although arthropods are the most numerous phylum on Earth, and thousands of arthropod species are venomous, they inflict relatively few serious bites and stings on humans.
The stiff cuticles of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system.
Recent studies strongly suggest that Crustacea, as traditionally defined, is paraphyletic, with Hexapoda having evolved from within it, so that Crustacea and Hexapoda form a clade, Pancrustacea.
The exocuticle and endocuticle together are known as the procuticle.
In 1960 R. E. Snodgrass even hoped it would not be solved, as trying to work out solutions was so much fun.
Most arthropods lack balance and acceleration sensors, and rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up.
In many arthropods, appendages have vanished from some regions of the body, and it is particularly common for abdominal appendages to have disappeared or be highly modified.
Efforts to control arthropod pests by large-scale use of pesticides have caused long-term effects on human health and on biodiversity.
Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus.
The mite ''Varroa destructor'' has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide.
Arthropods' primary internal cavity is a hemocoel, which accommodates their internal organs, and through which their haemolymph – analogue of blood – circulates; they have open circulatory systems.
One arthropod sub-group, insects, is the most species-rich member of all ecological guilds in land and fresh-water environments.
They have remained almost entirely aquatic, possibly because they never developed excretory systems that conserve water.
One of the newer hypotheses is that the chelicerae have originated from the same pair of appendages that evolved into antennae in the ancestors of Mandibulata, which would place trilobites, which had antennae, closer to Mandibulata than Chelicerata.
However, many malacostracan crustaceans have statocysts, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate inner ear.
Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages.
There are two different types of arthropod excretory systems.
Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''Stygotantulus'' up to the Japanese spider crab.
Some specific species are known to spread severe disease to humans, livestock, and crops.
Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors; for example, all spiders extend their legs hydraulically and can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level.
The evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the Cambrian period.
''Anopheles'' mosquito
"foot" or "leg", which together mean "jointed leg".
In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of subesophageal ganglia, under and behind the esophagus.
The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods provide a large number of fossil spiders, including representatives of many modern families.
This reasoning implies that ''Parapeytoia'', which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is ''Anomalocaris''.
It has been proposed that the Ediacaran animals ''Parvancorina'' and ''Spriggina'', from around 555 million years ago, were arthropods.
Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments.
The self-righting behavior of cockroaches is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure.
Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages.
However, most arthropods rely on sexual reproduction, and parthenogenetic species often revert to sexual reproduction when conditions become less favorable.
However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination: a 2008 study examined the 100&nbsp;crops that FAO lists as grown for food, and estimated pollination's economic value as €153&nbsp;billion, or 9.5% of the value of world agricultural production used for human food in 2005.
The embryos of all arthropods are segmented, built from a series of repeated modules.
Arthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems.
A few such species rely on females to find spermatophores that have already been deposited on the ground, but in most cases males only deposit spermatophores when complex courtship rituals look likely to be successful.
Phylogenetic relationships of the major extant arthropod groups according to Regier et al.
Many species of arthropods, principally insects but also mites, are agricultural and forest pests.
, schools, research facilities and cultural events.
All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.
A few species of insects and crustaceans can reproduce by parthenogenesis, for example, without mating, especially if conditions favor a "population explosion".
Some living crustaceans are much larger; for example, the legs of the Japanese spider crab may span up to , with the heaviest of all living arthropods being the American lobster, topping out at over 20&nbsp;kg (44&nbsp;lbs).
Further analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are monophyletic, in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.
Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated.
+ Diseases transmitted by insects
Arthropod exoskeletons are made of cuticle, a non-cellular material secreted by the epidermis.
Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and tracheates, use respiratory pigments to assist oxygen transport.
Dragonfly larvae have the typical cuticles and jointed limbs of arthropods but are flightless water-breathers with extendable jaws.
Opiliones (harvestmen), millipedes, and some crustaceans use modified appendages such as gonopods or penises to transfer the sperm directly to the female.
It was a non-discriminatory sediment feeder, processing whatever sediment came its way for food.
Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light.
The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a hydrostatic skeleton, which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move.
Increasing arthropod resistance to pesticides has led to the development of integrated pest management using a wide range of measures including biological control.
Simplified summary of Budd's "broad-scale" cladogram (1996)
Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.
Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own lens and cornea.
Overall however, the basal relationships of Metazoa are not yet well resolved.
Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of convergent evolution, as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented exoskeletons; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have biramous limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have uniramous limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.
On the other hand, the relatively large size of ommatidia makes the images rather coarse, and compound eyes are shorter-sighted than those of birds and mammals&nbsp;– although this is not a severe disadvantage, as objects and events within  are most important to most arthropods.
Newly born arthropods have diverse forms, and insects alone cover the range of extremes.
They are important members of marine, freshwater, land and air ecosystems, and are one of only two major animal groups that have adapted to life in dry environments; the other is amniotes, whose living members are reptiles, birds and mammals.
In some segments of all known arthropods the appendages have been modified, for example to form gills, mouth-parts, antennae for collecting information, or claws for grasping; arthropods are "like Swiss Army knives, each equipped with a unique set of specialized tools."
Higher up the "family tree", the Annelida have traditionally been considered the closest relatives of the Panarthropoda, since both groups have segmented bodies, and the combination of these groups was labelled Articulata.
The lightest insects weigh less than 25&nbsp;micrograms (millionths of a gram), while the heaviest weigh over .
The number of species remains difficult to determine.
Arthropods were well pre-adapted to colonize land, because their existing jointed exoskeletons provided protection against desiccation, support against gravity and a means of locomotion that was not dependent on water.
When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.
The respiratory and excretory systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong.
Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.
The cuticle of crustaceans are also biomineralized with calcium carbonate.
In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that metabolise nitrogen is ammonia, which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water.
The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs.
Besides pollinating, bees produce honey, which is the basis of a rapidly growing industry and international trade.
The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.
They include lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish, shrimp and many others.
Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen.
The relative simplicity of the arthropods' body plan, allowing them to move on a variety of surfaces both on land and in water, have made them useful as models for robotics.
The proprioceptors of arthropods, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood.
