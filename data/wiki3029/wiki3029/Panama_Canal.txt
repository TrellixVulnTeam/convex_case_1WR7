Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown.
In the meanwhile they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise, and Bunau-Varilla eventually managed to persuade de Lesseps that a lock-and-lake canal was more realistic than a sea-level canal.
The allowed dimensions of ships using these locks increased by 25% in length, 51% in beam, and 26% in draft, as defined by New Panamax metrics.
The central wall between the parallel locks at Gatun is  thick and over  high.
An additional artificial lake, Alajuela Lake (known during the American era as Madden Lake), acts as a reservoir for the canal.
One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan.
The new lock chambers feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and are  long,  wide, and  deep.
This is because of a local anomaly in the shape of the isthmus at the point the canal occupies.
By early July 2012, however, it was announced that the canal expansion project had fallen six months behind schedule, leading expectations for the expansion to open in April 2015 rather than October 2014, as originally planned.
The construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than  of material over and above the  excavated by the French.
In 1907, Stevens resigned as chief engineer, having in his view made success certain.
Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger.
Each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of Gatun Lake; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks was not replicated.
As with container ships, reduced tolls are charged for freight ships "in ballast", $4.19, $4.12, $4.05 respectively.
While globally the Atlantic Ocean is east of the isthmus and the Pacific is west, the general direction of the canal passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific is from northwest to southeast.
The government of Nicaragua hopes this will boost the economy; the opposition is concerned with its environmental impact.
The most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on April 14, 2010 to the cruise ship ''Norwegian Pearl,'' which paid US$375,600.
Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canal's Atlantic and Pacific outlets.
Gatun Lake also serves to provide the millions of gallons of water necessary to operate the Panama Canal locks each time a ship passes through, and provides drinking water for Panama City and Colón.
Small (less than 125&nbsp;ft) vessels up to 583 PC/UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo, or up to 735 PC/UMS net tons when in ballast, or up to 1,048 fully loaded displacement tons, are assessed minimum tolls based upon their length overall, according to the following table (as of 29 April 2015):
This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009.
In 2006 it was anticipated that by 2011, 37% of the world's container ships would be too large for the present canal, and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share.
(The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.)
This would create both the largest dam (Gatun Dam) and the largest man-made lake (Gatun Lake) in the world at that time.
The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the previous locks were capable of handling.
A U.S. government commission, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), was established to oversee construction and was given control of the Panama Canal Zone, over which the United States exercised sovereignty.
Each lock chamber will have three water-saving basins, which will reuse 60% of the water in each transit.
Nothing came of that plan either.)
The lowest toll ever paid was 36 cents, by American Richard Halliburton who swam the Panama Canal in 1928.
Stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the United States and other areas to come to the Canal Zone to work, and tried to provide accommodation in which the incoming workers could work and live in reasonable safety and comfort.
For container ships, the toll is assessed on the ship's capacity expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), one TEU being the size of a standard intermodal shipping container.
The total cost is unknown since the expansion's contractors are seeking at least an addition  from the canal authority due to excess expenses.
The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels, but the project was canceled after World War II.
The average toll is around US$54,000.
Morgan Adams of Los Angeles, California, holds the distinction of paying the first toll received by the United States Government for the use of the Panama Canal by a pleasure boat.
On July 7, 2014, Wang Jing, chairman of the HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co. Ltd. (HKND Group) advised that a route for Nicaragua's proposed canal had been approved.
(see '''tolls''', check '''preface''' for symbols explaining changes.)
In June 2015, flooding of the new locks began: first on the Atlantic side, then on the Pacific; by then, the canal's re-inauguration was slated for April 2016.
Since a ship will have to go upward to Gatun Lake first and then descend, a single passing will cost double the amount; but the same waterflow cycle can be used for another ship passing in the opposite direction.
US$3,200plus $72/TEU
The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016.
The steel lock gates measure an average of  thick,  wide, and  high.
In 1905, a U.S. engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design, which still had not been finalized.

These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States.
More than 24.384&nbsp;meters (80&nbsp;ft) up to 30.480&nbsp;meters (100&nbsp;ft)
These water-saving basins will diminish water loss and preserve freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing water from the basins into the locks.
* The Culebra Cut slices  through the mountain ridge, crosses the continental divide and passes under the Centennial Bridge.
Unrest culminated in riots on Martyr's Day, January 9, 1964, when about 20 Panamanians and 3–5 U.S. soldiers were killed.
Because canal tolls have risen as ships have become larger, some critics have suggested that the Suez Canal is now a viable alternative for cargo en route from Asia to the U.S. East Coast.
Nearby is Panama City.
World-famous Barro Colorado Island, which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is today operated by the Smithsonian Institution, is the largest island on Gatun Lake.
This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and suction dredger, and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20%.
After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated.

Stevens successfully convinced Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of the alternative scheme.
Passenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as cruise ships, pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds.
The new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a  channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting Miraflores Lake.
For $10 million and an annual payment it would have granted the United States a renewable lease in perpetuity from Colombia on the land proposed for the canal.
By the 1930s it was seen that water supply would be an issue for the canal; this prompted the building of the Madden Dam across the Chagres River above Gatun Lake.
Steam shovels were used in the construction of the canal, and they were purchased from Bay City Industrial Works, a business owned by William L. Clements in Bay City, Michigan.

French success in building the Suez Canal, while a lengthy project, encouraged planning for one to cross the isthmus.
Although the Panama Canal would eventually have to be only 40% as long as the Suez Canal, the former would prove to be far more of an engineering challenge, due to the tropical rain forests, the climate, the need for canal locks, and the lack of any ancient route to follow.
The project was inspired by the diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was able to raise considerable finance in France as a result of the huge profits generated by his successful construction of the Suez Canal.
His report was published as a book entitled ''The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans''.

At the time it was formed, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world.
The Bridge of the Americas () at the Pacific side is about a third of a degree east of the Colón end on the Atlantic side.
The Pacific Division, under Sydney B. Williamson (the only civilian member of this high-level team), was similarly responsible for the Pacific  breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel to the locks, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams and reservoirs.
The project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025.
During the dry season, when there is less rainfall, there is also a shortfall of water in Gatun Lake.

* A  channel forms the approach to the locks from the Atlantic side.
As demand is rising for efficient global shipping of goods, the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future.
The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage.
In June 1902, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of pursuing the Panamanian option, provided the necessary rights could be obtained, in the Spooner Act.
The U.S. formally took control of the canal property on May 4, 1904, inheriting from the French a depleted workforce and a vast jumble of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of it in poor condition.
On November 6, 1903, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, as Panama's ambassador to the United States, signed the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, granting rights to the United States to build and indefinitely administer the Panama Canal Zone and its defenses.

In addition, improvements have been made to the canal's operating machinery, including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than  of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls.
Locally called Sargento and believed to be the species ''Cichla pleiozona'', these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama, but originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro, and Orinoco river basins of South America, where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and considered a premier game fish.
Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction.
This vessel crossed the canal from the Atlantic in stages during construction, finally reaching the Pacific on January 7, 1914.
The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year from about 14,000 total annual transits.
Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons.
Given the strategic location of Panama and the potential offered by its narrow isthmus separating two great oceans, other trade links in the area were attempted over the years.
At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal (and/or a railroad) across Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

More than 30.480&nbsp;meters (100&nbsp;ft)
After World War II, U.S. control of the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it became contentious; relations between Panama and the United States became increasingly tense.
Goethals would direct the work in Panama to a successful conclusion.
Such a route would have given the Spanish a military advantage over the Portuguese.
There was a delay of less than two months however, with work by the consortium members reaching goals by June 2014.
Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage, and in some cases depend on the locks used.
The crossing occurred during a 6,000-mile sea voyage from Jacksonville, Florida, to Los Angeles in 1914.
This flooded the Culebra Cut, thereby joining the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
The opening of Panama Canal in 1914 caused a severe drop in traffic along Chilean ports due to shifts in the maritime trade routes.
This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal.
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the ACP has developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion, which will protect the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed.

These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs.
The normal fee would have been just US$13,430.
The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for handover to Panama.
The first phase of the project was the dry excavations of the  wide trench connecting the Gaillard Cut with the Pacific coast, removing 47 million cubic meters of earth and rock.
In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.
(a floating crane built by Lobnitz & Company, and launched in 1887) was the first self-propelled vessel to transit the canal from ocean to ocean.
Thus in 1904, the United States purchased the French equipment and excavations, including the Panama Railroad, for US$40 million, of which $30 million related to excavations completed, primarily in the Gaillard Cut (then called the Culebra Cut), valued at about $1.00 per cubic yard.
The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock.
These gravity-fed basins allow 60% of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7% less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes.
In 1788, Thomas Jefferson suggested that the Spanish should create it since it would be a less treacherous route than going around the southern tip of South America, which tropical ocean currents would naturally widen thereafter.
The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009.
A minimal workforce of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the Colombian Panama Canal concession, to run the Panama Railroad, and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition.
There was investment in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water.
After completion, expansion will guarantee the availability and quality of water resources by using water-saving basins at each new lock.
The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo ("in ballast").
Eventually a compromise was made and the locks were built  wide.
After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, in 1999 the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government and is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.
Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the Gaillard (Culebra) Cut.
Effective April 1, 2016, this toll went from US$74.00 per loaded container to $60.00 per TEU capacity plus $30.00 per loaded container for a potential $90 per TEU when the ship is full.
A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016.
According to the deal, the company will be responsible for operating and maintaining the canal for a 50-year period.
Other mechanical and electrical equipment was limited in its capabilities, and steel equipment rusted rapidly in the climate.
, this toll is US$5.25 per ton for the first 10,000 tons, US$5.14 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$5.06 per ton thereafter.
(a cargo and passenger ship built by Maryland Steel, and launched in 1902 as SS ''Tremont'') was the first ship to transit the canal from ocean to ocean on August 3, 1914.
The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Howard Taft and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier.
The treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on December 31, 1999, and the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) assumed command of the waterway.
Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; according to the ACP, since 2000, it has ranged between 20 and 30 hours.
At this time, the President and the Senate of the United States were interested in establishing a canal across the isthmus, with some favoring a canal across Nicaragua and others advocating the purchase of the French interests in Panama.
Almost immediately, the treaty was condemned by many Panamanians as an infringement on their country's new national sovereignty.
Many of the most important groundbreaking scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here.
His men were totally unprepared for the rainy season, during which the Chagres River, where the canal started, became a raging torrent, rising up to 35 feet (10 m).
There are a total of nine basins for each of the two lock complexes, and a total of 18 basins for the entire project.
As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work.
The proposal to expand the canal was approved in a national referendum by about 80% on October 22, 2006.
Overwhelmed by the disease-plagued country and forced to use often dilapidated French infrastructure and equipment, as well as being frustrated by the overly bureaucratic ICC, Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905.
However, plans to construct these sea-rail-sea links have yet to materialize.
This is sometimes misinterpreted as the "99-year lease" because of misleading wording included in article 22 of the agreement.
De Lesseps and his son Charles were found guilty of misappropriation of funds and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, though this was later overturned, and the father, at 88, was never imprisoned.
The layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific is as follows:
The per-berth charge since April 1, 2016 is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the Panamax locks.
Most other types of vessel pay a toll per PC/UMS net ton, in which one "ton" is actually a volume of .
The United States spent almost $375,000,000 (roughly equivalent to $8,600,000,000 now) to finish the project.
Today these areas remain practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas on earth where various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat.
