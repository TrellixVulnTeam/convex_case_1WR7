Mills of this period were from 25 to 68&nbsp;m long and 11.5&nbsp;m to 14&nbsp;m wide.
It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton ring mill.
It was bought up by Courtaulds in August 1964.
From the Factory Act of 1844, until 1878 records do not distinguish between full-time and half-times.
The phrase Oldham Limiteds describes these companies.
They used a belt and pulley drive system, and heavier ring frames rather than mules.
A further attempt to mechanise the weaving process took place at Garrett Hall in Manchester in 1750 but was unsuccessful in enabling one worker to operate more than a single loom.
Although its technology was similar to that of Lewis Paul, John Wyatt, James Hargreaves and Thomas Highs, Arkwright's powers of organisation, business acumen and ambition established the cotton mill as a successful business model and revolutionary example of the factory system.
Slater Mill resembled the Beverly Cotton Manufactory and a mill in Derbyshire in which he had worked.
Later mills had a water tank at the top of the stair tower.
In an 1870 mill the bay was typically , and the brick vaults  though there were variations.
The steam engines were typically low-pressure single-cylinder condensing beam engines.
Mills from 1825 to 1865 were generally constructed with wooden beamed floors and lath and plaster ceilings.
For Example, In Glossop, there were 931 children (out of 3562) between 5 and thirteen working in cotton mills.
By 1880 there were 58 mills in India employing 40,000 workers, with over 80% of them in the cities of Bombay and Ahmedabad.
These Corliss valves were more efficient and more reliable than their predecessors.
Water pressure needed to be above 7&nbsp;psi, and the header tank at least  above the highest sprinkler.
The earliest cotton mills were driven by water, so needed to be situated on fast flowing streams.
Experience from this factory led Moses Brown of Providence to request the assistance of a person skilled in water-powered spinning.
The mills are distinguished from warehouses in that warehouses had taking-in doors on each storey with an external hoist beam.
Their dues were high, so the fighting fund was large and the officials were skilled in defending the complex wage structures.
The first mills using fireproof construction were built in Shropshire and Derbyshire in the 1790s and Philips & Lee's mill built in Salford in 1801-2.
Another change was the trend of having carding on one floor.
That power plant provided for 4,800 horse power.
In 1771, while the Nottingham mill was at an experimental stage, Arkwright and his partners started work on Cromford Mill in Derbyshire, which "was to prove a major turning point in the history of the factory system".
A new approach was to use thick cotton ropes.
In some mills timber was also eliminated from the roof structure which was supported by cast or wrought iron trusses.
These were the later larger mills.
Intermediate Scutchers
They were built in the southern states of South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi where cheap labour and plentiful water power made operations profitable.
The floors were higher allowing for taller windows.
It was of four storeys and had sixteen bays on each side of a central engine house; a double mill.
:* Sanitation to be improved
The town was named Ware Shoals.
The Yorkshire worsted industry, adopted the ring frame which required less skill.
Construction was sometimes to fireproof designs.
The same applied to ear protectors.
Boulton and Watt's engines enabled mills to be built in urban contexts and transformed the economy of Manchester, whose importance had previously been as a centre of pre-industrial spinning and weaving based on the domestic system.
In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do open-end spinning in Atherton.
In 1929, for the first time there were more spindles in the USA than in the UK.
The last steam-powered mill, Elk Mill, was built by Arthur Turner
When Lancashire adopted cotton, the same process occurred.
The small weavers banded together to form self-help guilds.
In the 1840s George Henry Corliss of Providence, Rhode Island improved the reliability of stationary steam engines.
+Percentage of children below 13 in cotton factories 1835–78
By the 1890s this was common.
To achieve this, the ground floor was extended outwards behind the mill often a full mill width.
Poor conditions became the subject of exposés, and in England, the Factory Acts were written to regulate them.
Unionism did not develop in Yorkshire until 1914.
Etched and stained glass was used in the offices.
1860 saw the end of this period of rapid growth.
They could be eight storeys high and had basements and attics.
The Lancashire boiler was patented in 1844, and the economiser in 1845.
Mills were made by millwrights, builders and iron founders.
From about 1820, the stationary steam engine became the normal form of power for a cotton mill, water was still needed to produce the steam and to condense it, to maintain the humidity, for many of the finishing processes and for firefighting.
It was generated in the engine house, and one group-drive electric motor was placed on each floor to drive the shafts.
The central block provided offices and warehousing.
Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms.
Just before 1870, a mill was built by a joint-stock spinning company and this financial structure led to a new wave of mill construction.
Ring frames replaced mule frames; they were heavier and larger and were placed transversely, the floors became larger (up to  wide) and higher to provide light.
They were single-storey sheds with an engine house and offices, and preparation and warehousing in a two-storey ancillary building.
Power was transmitted by a main vertical shaft with bevel gears to the horizontal shafts.
The average age of installed rotors is much lower than that of spindles and as rotors are between 7 and 10 times more productive they are responsible for 20% of the cotton spun worldwide.
The industry peaked in 1907.
Other mills were built north of the River Ribble and a cluster of five mills in Caton near the port at Lancaster, one of which belonged to Samuel Greg who built Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire.
:* Compulsory education to be provided in the arts of reading writing and arithmetic
The British government, starved of raw cotton, established mills in south Asia exporting the spinning technology - which was copied, and became a low-labour cost competitor.
Following the American Civil War, mills grew larger.
The cotton industry was subject to cycles of boom and slump, which caused waves of mill building.
It closed in 1959 taking advantage of the Cotton Industry Act 1959 and was then used by the John Myers mail order company.
In merged 105 companies, ending up in 1950 with 53 operating mills.
But in Lancashire cotton mills, spinning became a male occupation, and the tradition of unions passed into the factory.
While the number of children working in spinning as tenters did decline, more were employed in weaving because weavers were expected to tenter extra looms.
Steam engine drove generators to provide electric lighting.
Abbey Mill Oldham (1876) needed 700&nbsp;hp, Nile Mill (1896) needed 2500&nbsp;hp.
One point of view in the 1880s was that vertically integrating the weaving sheds into new mills would reduce costs and lead to greater profits.
The Lancashire and Derbyshire mills needed a pool of cheap labour.
Cotton could be processed into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs.
Until the properties of cast iron were properly understood some mills constructed using the early technology collapsed.
In 1833 the largest mill was that of McConnel and Company in Ancoats, Manchester with 1,545 workers, but in 1841 there were still only 25 mills in Lancashire with 1,000 workers or more, and the number of workers in the average mill was 193.
Decoration was often in terracotta and the mill name displayed in white brick on the stir tower or chimney.
61% of the 575,000 cotton operatives in Lancashire were women, of which 61% were unionised in 167 different unions
In the mid-16th century Manchester was an important manufacturing centre for woollens and linen and market for textiles made elsewhere.
The early mills were of light construction, narrow – about  wide – and low in height, with ceiling heights of only 6–8&nbsp;ft.
In Manchester extensive testing of cast iron as a structural material was carried out by Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn in the early 1820s.
Open sewers and shared privies led to diseases such as cholera; Manchester was hit by an epidemic in 1831 that claimed hundreds of lives.
After the war, the economics of the industry had changed, and a new larger mill was required.
Mules were used in the 19th century mills for the finest counts, these needed skilled workers to operate them.
Slater evaded restrictions on emigration put in place to allow England to maintain its monopoly on cotton mills.
The mules with 250–350 spindles were placed transversely to get as much light as possible.
Each room in the mill would have line shafts suitable for the type of frame, connected by belt drives or gearing.
Single-storey north light weaving sheds were sometimes added to the mills.
The chimneys were round and taller.
Most mills were built for mules.
The mills used 300,000&nbsp;hp of power, of which 18,500 was generated by waterpower.
The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.

By 1950 all mills had converted to the Ring frame.
Rope drives were used exclusively.
Pear Mill Bredbury (1912) was planned to be a 210,000 spindle double mill.
Mills generated employment, drawing workers from largely rural areas and expanding urban populations.
Heating systems used wrought iron pipes suspended at a height of  to carry steam under pressure.
The Paul-Wyatt mills spun cotton for several decades but were not very profitable, becoming the ancestors of the cotton mills that followed.
This did not reduce the number of children, half-timers worked mornings in the mill and spend the afternoon in the school room.
It imported 3.3 million bales and exported 80% of its production.
The machines were the first to spin cotton mechanically "without the intervention of human fingers".
Brunswick Mill was a 28-bay mill, 6 storeys of 16&nbsp;m by 92&nbsp;m. Each self-acting spinning mule had 500&nbsp;spindles.
The mill contained 30,000 spindles.
Living condition were poor in 'Prentice Houses', and the children who were paid 2d a day worked 15-hour shifts, hot bedding with children on the other shift.
The principles of the spinning jenny and water frame were combined by Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule of 1779, but water power was not applied to it until 1792.
Cotton mills were not confined to Lancashire but were built in northeast Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottingham, the West Riding of Yorkshire, Bristol, Durham and the west of Scotland.
The air in the mill was thick with cotton dust, which could lead to byssinosis – a lung disease.
William Fairbairn experimented with cast iron beams and concrete floors.
In Germany, Flanders and Brazil, mills were built to the designs of the Oldham architects.
The cotton mill, originally a Lancashire phenomenon, was copied in New England and later in the southern states of America.
However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged by a new technology open-end or break spinning.
In 1788 Cartwright opened Revolution Mill in Doncaster which was powered by a Boulton and Watt steam engine and had 108 power looms on three floors as well as spinning machinery, but it was not a commercial success and closed in 1790.
The war of 1914–1918 put the Lancashire industry into reverse.
In summer the system was barely used but in winter the boilers would be fired up two hours before the shift started to warm up the mill.
The development of cotton mills was linked to the development of the machinery they contained.
Cotton mills were huge fire risks, cotton fibres in the air could form an explosive mixture in their gas-lit interiors.
:* Each apprentice to be provided with two suits of clothes
This route had been followed in New England, where it was successful, but not in Lancashire.
Accrington brick was used from 1890, decorated with yellow sandstone with moulded brick and terracotta features.
The workers, 90 per cent of whom were adults and 56 per cent females, were paid a total of  ₤11.5&nbsp;million per annum.
They lived in company-owned boarding houses, and attended churches supported by the companies.
He licensed his technology to other entrepreneurs and in 1782 boasted that his machinery was being used by "numbers of adventurers residing in the different counties of Derby, Leicester, Nottingham, Worcester, Stafford, York, Hertford and Lancashire" and by 1788 there were 143 Arkwright-type mills nationwide.
J. M. Keynes suggested that there was over capacity, and the industry should be reorganised into larger units that would scrap the excess capacity.
Though there was a slight revival after 1945, mills closed.
Vertical Openers and scutchers
They provided incomes for girls and women.
Child labour was used in the mills, and the factory system led to organised labour.
The bay size in a mill was defined by the positioning of machines.
The roller spinning principle of Paul and Bourne became the basis of Richard Arkwright's spinning frame and water frame, patented in 1769.
The mills were mainly in open country and mill towns were formed to support them.
The availability of streams or rivers to provide power determined the location of the early mills some of which were in isolated areas.
Cardroom Operatives
The well paid mule spinners were the 'barefoot aristocrats' of labour and became organised in the 19th century.
At Rutledge Ford the Saluda River was dammed and a power plant constructed.
The group devised the Waltham System of working, which was duplicated at Lowell, Massachusetts and several other new cities throughout the state.

The most efficient mills had abandoned their steam engines, and were working the frames with individual electric motors.
The power needed and provided to drive these mills was increasing.
Water for the sprinklers had to be protected from freezing and evaporation.
Unsurprisingly, a series of Factory Acts were passed to attempt to ameliorate these conditions.
The engines were double compound upright beam engines of the type patented by McNaught in 1845.
The mills, often 'L' or U-shaped, were narrow and multi-storeyed.
The engine needed more space and the engine house, boiler house and economiser were external to the main mill.
In a single mill, the crosswall divided the blowing room from the rest, as it was here that there was greatest risk of fire.
finishing deliveries of drawing
In Lancashire and Piedmont, South Carolina child labour is well documented.
Fireproof construction was expensive and timber, sometimes clad in plaster or metal continued to be used throughout the 19th century.
Electricity was used to drive the mills machinery by 1906.
The development of mills to mechanise the weaving process was more gradual partly because of the success of John Kay's 1733 invention of the flying shuttle, which increased the productivity of domestic hand loom weavers.
In Lancashire there were:
The mill built in 1978 was built on the Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One.
The lubrication was carcinogenic and led to cancers of the mouth and cancer of the scrotum; known as mule-spinners cancer.

In the 20th century, North West England lost its supremacy to the United States, then to India and subsequently to China.
Despite the ban on exporting technology from the UK, one of its proprietors, Francis Cabot Lowell, had travelled to Manchester to study the mill system and memorised some of its details.
The spinners union, the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners had a federal structure with strong central leadership where control was in the hands of a small group of paid officials.
Mills were of red brick or sometimes local stone with a greater attention to decoration and the main gate was often highlighted with stone decoration.
There was an optimism that dictated that slumps had to be endured and then there would be a period of even greater prosperity.
The early mills had a vertical shaft to take the power from the flywheel.
Mains driven mills started about 1907.
Kay took out a patent for the application of water power to a Dutch loom in 1745 and opened a weaving factory in Keighley in 1750, but nothing is known of its success.
The looms caused vibrations that damaged the structure of multi-storey buildings, and specialised weaving mills became common.
The average power in 1835 was 48&nbsp;hp.
The air in the mill had to be hot and humid to prevent the thread from breaking: 18&nbsp;°C to 26&nbsp;°C and 85% humidity was normal.
In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring spinning spindles installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in Asia or Oceania and 44% being within China.
Mills of this period were large, their decoration was lavish reflecting Edwardian taste and prosperity.
There were two or three windows per bay.
During this period the mules got wider and the width of the bays increased.
It was completed in 1904 before the construction of a state-of-the-art textile mill in 1906.
The mills had 30,387,467 spindles and 350,000 power looms.
Mills of this period were tall, narrow, and wide.
The only new mills were very large to benefit from the economies of scale.
This was a prominent change as a rope race had to be built running the height of the mill.
The limited companies took control of spinning, while the room and power system was the norm for the weaving sheds.
Rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete flooring was introduced in a limited way in the 1880s but not widely adopted in Lancashire mills until the 20th century.
The 18th-century woollen industry of small producers in southern England was far different from the Yorkshire-based worsted industry where the clothier imported and owned the raw material and sold the cloth.
Family-run firms continued to build, but grouped into associations such as the Fine Spinners' and Doublers' Association.
Worsted spinning was an occupation for young girls.
The mills were usually combination mills, (spinning and weaving) that were water powered and used a slow burn design technique.
By the 1960s the mill employed 5,000 people.

This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929.
A mill worker could expect to work a thirteen-hour day, six days a week with two weeks off for the wakes week holidays in summer.
Daniels and Jewkes argued the fundamental cause of the depression was a change in demand for cotton goods.
Not all water-powered mills were in rural areas, after 1780 mills were built in Blackburn and Burnley.

By the 1890, boilers produced 160&nbsp;psi, and the triple expansion horizontals became standard.
Four mills were set up to house Paul and Wyatt's machinery in the decade following its patent in 1738: the short-lived, animal-powered Upper Priory Cotton Mill in Birmingham in 1741; Marvel's Mill in Northampton operated from 1742 until 1764 and was the first to be powered by a water wheel; Pinsley Mill in Leominster probably opened in 1744 and operated until it burned down in 1754; and a second mill in Birmingham set up by Samuel Touchet in 1744, about which little is known, but which was sufficiently successful for Touchet later to seek the lease on the mill in Northampton.
Regulation was ineffective until the mills were subject to inspection in 1833 with the establishment of a factory inspectorate consisting of four factory inspectors who had the power of magistrates.
Specialist architects built new mills and then created extensions.
