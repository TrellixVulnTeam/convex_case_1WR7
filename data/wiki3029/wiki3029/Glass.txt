Mass production of glass window panes in the early twentieth century caused a similar effect.
Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.
For example, the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases.

Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was also used in jewelry.
In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used.
The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection.
Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded.
The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.

Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th-century.
The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide CaO, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability.
Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives.
Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps.
Because of its high density (resulting in a high electron density) it has a high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant (called "crystal", though of course it is a glass and not a crystal).
The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition.
At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero.

Pyrex) have as main constituents silica and boron oxide.
These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets.
Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material.

Surface treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened glass, bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating).
Yet there is a nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.
More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter.
The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand.
The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above).

The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another.
The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows.
The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.

Glass batch calculation is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is determined to achieve the desired glass composition.
The term ''glass'', in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles.
These sheets were cut into smaller window panes with nonuniform thickness, typically with the location of the pour centered in one of the panes (known as "bull's-eyes") for decorative effect.
According to Fresnel equations, the reflectivity of a sheet of glass is about 4% per surface (at normal incidence in air), and the transmissivity of one element (two surfaces) is about 90%.
There are three classes of components for oxide glasses: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers.
The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase.
The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority.
Modern glass intended for windows is produced as float glass and is very uniform in thickness.
These are useful because the solubility of the compound is greatly increased when it is amorphous compared to the same crystalline composition.

Addition of fluorine lowers the dielectric constant of glass.
and for halogen bulb glass.
Several other points can be considered that contradict the "cathedral glass flow" theory:
Lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion.
A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere.
Stands heat expansion much better than window glass.
With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent.

In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks have increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.
Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels.
Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), splat quenching (pressing the melt between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).
The shafts of these brightly colored studs were inserted through a hole in the earlobe to display the studs' circular heads.
Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace.
This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory.
When applied to whiteware ceramics, vitreous means the material has an extremely low permeability to liquids, often but not always water, when determined by a specified test regime.

Any slight deformation in the antique telescopic lenses would lead to a dramatic decrease in optical performance, a phenomenon that is not observed.
But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt.
These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.
This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.
In 2004, NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase (dubbed "q-glass") could be grown from the melt.

The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders.
One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, "soda"), which lowers the glass transition temperature.
This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.
The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun.
They are formed as a glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment.
The lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock.
where certain thermodynamic variables such as volume, entropy and enthalpy are discontinuous through the glass transition range.
Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) have to take this in account.
After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed.
This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.
They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass ), making them more dimensionally stable.
When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and "cook" times.
The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature.

The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties.
In ancient China, though, glassmaking seems to have a late start, compared to ceramics and metal work.
Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, which gives rise to one of silicate glasses' primary uses as window panes.
From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis.
In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads.
Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt.
In the 21st century, scientists observing the properties of ancient stained glass windows, in which suspended nanoparticles prevent UV light from causing chemical reactions that change image colors, are developing photographic techniques that use similar stained glass to capture true color images of Mars for the 2019 ESA Mars Rover mission.
Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2.
The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby.
Due to chemical bonding characteristics glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra.
