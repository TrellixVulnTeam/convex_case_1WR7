The Fraser River salmon population was affected by the 1914 slide caused by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Hells Gate.
Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they were born to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true.
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on ''Henneguya salminicola'' was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.
'''Salmon'''  is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae.
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.

Both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are popular sportfish.
In response to the elimination of beavers from large parts of the river system, salmon runs plummeted, even in the absence of many of the factors usually associated with the demise of salmon runs.
To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them.
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."
Salmon recruitment can be affected by beavers' dams because dams can:
*Slow the rate at which nutrients are flushed from the system; nutrients provided by adult salmon dying throughout the fall and winter remain available in the spring to newly hatched juveniles
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.
It offers the advantage of providing natural amounts of dietary fiber and having a lower glycemic load than grain-based fish meal.
Another form of salmon production, which is safer but less controllable, is to raise salmon in hatcheries until they are old enough to become independent.
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering .
These dams can be overtopped at high tide and hold water at low tide.
(When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland.)
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.

The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh.
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.
Many species of salmon  have  been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia  in South America.
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.
Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds.
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.
Classified as an oily fish, salmon is considered to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content.

It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies.
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.
Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.''
Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium).
Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish.

The report also states, "It should be stressed that ''Henneguya'', economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.
Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.

Farm-raised salmon are fed the carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin to match their flesh colour to wild salmon to improve their marketability.
Seaweed provides essential minerals and vitamins for growing organisms.
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.
Because of this, the ranching method has mainly been used by various public authorities and nonprofit groups, such as the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association, as a way to increase salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvesting, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or fragmentation.
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.
