The body should be put in strict quarantine.
The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as follows: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs.
Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body.
Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell.
However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores.

To support the cover-up story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals.
Such spores can be found on all continents, including Antarctica.
Herbivores are often infected whilst grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation: the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the gastrointestinal tract permitting entry of the bacterial endospores into the tissues, though this has not been proven.
All possibly contaminated bedding or clothing should be isolated in double plastic bags and treated as possible biohazard waste.
