The effects of the raids on Guernica and Madrid caused many civilian casualties and a wave of protests in the democracies.
In 1936 the Junkers Ju 52 was the backbone of the German bomber fleet.
Kesselring and Udet did not get on.
During the Battle of Britain, however, despite causing severe damage to the RAF's infrastructure and British cities during the subsequent Blitz, it did not achieve victory.
Only the BMW 801F radial development, through its use of features coming from the 801E subtype, was able to substantially exceed the over-1,500&nbsp;kW output level — the F-version was tested at a top output level of some 1,765&nbsp;kW (2,400 PS) of take-off power.
Another prominent figure in German air power construction this time was Helmuth Wilberg.
The peacetime strength of the Luftwaffe in the spring of 1939 was 370, 000 men.
These facilities were moved to eastern Germany, away from possible Allied threats.
The failure to maximize production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the ''Luftwaffe''s effective defeat in the period of September 1943 – February 1944.
However Wever's vision of a "Ural" bomber was never realised, and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost, with the only design submittal for Wever's 'Bomber A' that would reach production being Heinkel's ''Projekt 1041'', which became officially known on 5 November 1937 as the Heinkel He 177.
By the time production reached acceptable levels, as so many other factors had for the ''Luftwaffe'' – and for the entire Wehrmacht military's weapons and ordnance technology as a whole – late in the war, it was "too little, too late".
Usually, the ''Kommodore'' would hold the rank of ''Oberstleutnant'' (lieutenant colonel) or, exceptionally, an ''Oberst'' (colonel).
Afterwards, although continuing to be trained in parachute delivery, paratroopers were only used in a parachute role for smaller-scale operations, such as the successful rescue of Benito Mussolini, the then-deposed dictator of Italy in 1943.
Roughly a further 360 pilots claimed between 40 and 100 aerial victories for round about 21,000 victories.
A number of crews were also lost to hypothermia during the Battle of Britain when planes ran out of fuel or were shot down and ditched in the English Channel.
Göring appointed his successor Albert Kesselring as CS and Ernst Udet head the Reich's Air Ministry Technical Office (''Technisches Amt''), although he was not a technical expert.
Under such circumstances, it was not possible for Milch, Udet or Kesselring to produce a formidable strategic bombing force even had they wanted to do so.
He appealed to the court requesting to be shot as a soldier.
This increase in weight affected the performance of the Fw 190 and Bf 109 at a time when the two aircraft were meeting large numbers of equal if not superior Allied types.
It was renamed ''Luftstreitkräfte'' on 8 October 1916.
As a result, the ''Luftwaffe'' grew to become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced and battle-experienced air forces in the world when war began in Europe in 1939.
In 1935, "''Luftwaffe'' Regulation 16: The Conduct of the Air War" was drawn up.
Udet realized that the upcoming war on Russia may cripple Germany.
Göring was prosecuted at the Nuremberg Trials after the war.
Each formations would have attached to it a number of units, usually several ''Geschwader'', but also independent ''Staffeln'' and ''Kampfgruppen''.
All first saw active service in the Condor Legion against Soviet-supplied aircraft.
To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets.2.
In 1935, this design competition led to the Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89 prototypes, although both were underpowered.
One of the many reasons for the failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1940 was that it did not have the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry, something that the much-anticipated ''Bomber B'' design competition was intended to address.
This resulted in a speed loss of 200&nbsp;km/h.
The Germans pushed for synthetic fuel plants, but still failed to meet demands.
Terror bombing was deemed to be "counter-productive", increasing rather than destroying the enemy's will to resist.
In fact, when protests were raised, Hans Jeschonnek, Chief of the General Staff of the ''Luftwaffe'', said, "First we've got to beat Russia, then we can start training!"
By the summer 1938 only 25% of requirements could be covered.
The OKL badly neglected the need for transport aircraft; even in 1943, transport units were described as ''Kampfgeschwadern zur besonderen Verwendung'' ("Bomber Units on Special Duties", KGzbV).
Hitler ordered his arrest and execution.
However, as a result of the lack of more comprehensive co-ordination between the RLM ministry and the OKL, all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short range aircraft, as they could be produced in greater numbers, rather than quality long range aircraft, something that put the ''Luftwaffe'' at a disadvantage as early as the Battle of Britain.
The ''Luftwaffe'' also greatly expanded its aircrew training programs by 42%, to 63 flying schools.
Many in the ''Luftwaffe'' command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; France, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
For that reason Göring could not have him as CS.
To paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments factories.
Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the ''Luftwaffe'', in particular rubber and aluminium.
The lack of strategic capability should have been apparent much earlier.
Moreover, ''Luftwaffe'' leadership from the start poached the training command, which undermined its ability to replace losses, while also planning for "short sharp campaigns", which did not pertain.
These failures were not exposed until wartime.
In addition, the OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require.
These younger commanders had to learn "in the field" rather than entering a post fully qualified.
Göring's control over all aspects of aviation became absolute.
By the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' (fighter wings) mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, four '''Zerstörergeschwader'' (destroyer wings) equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter, 11 ''Kampfgeschwader'' (bomber wings) equipped with mainly the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z; and as it had encountered design difficulties, was just starting to accept the Junkers Ju 88A for service with only a dozen aircraft of the type considered combat-ready, and four ''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' (dive bomber wings) ready for combat, primarily armed with the iconic Junkers Ju 87B ''Stuka''.
In the case of the Ju 88, 50,000 modifications had to be made.
To train its pilots on the latest combat aircraft, Germany solicited the help of its future enemy, the Soviet Union, which was also isolated in Europe.
As the war progressed more air fleets were created as the areas under German rule expanded.
The air force was not subordinated to the army support role, and it was not given any particular strategic mission.
Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes, although their design was the ''Kriegsmarine's'' responsibility, even considering production of the Japanese Type 91 torpedo used at Pearl Harbor as the ''Lufttorpedo'' '''LT 850''' by August 1942.
Contrary to popular belief in American and British circles, the ''Luftwaffe'' was not "the hand maiden of the German Army."
One of the unique characteristics of the ''Luftwaffe'' (as opposed to other independent air forces) was the possession of an organic paratrooper force called ''Fallschirmjäger''.
Flying in reinforcements and winning air superiority, the ''Luftwaffe'' contributed decisively to the German conquest and expulsion of the Western Allies from Scandinavia.
A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000&nbsp;m (66,000&nbsp;ft).
It has been suggested that the bombing of Guernica was carried out for military tactical reasons, in support of ground operations, but the town was not directly involved in any fighting at that point in time.
Other specialist staff were navigation, signals and intelligence personnel.
The defences were not coordinated and communication was poor.
Udet, torn between truth and loyalty, suffered a psychological breakdown and even tried to tell all the truth to Hitler, but Göring told Hitler, that Udet was lying, then took Udet under control by giving him drugs at drinking parties and hunting trips.
Göring was delighted with the performance.
Luftwaffe reached its largest personnel strength during the period November 1943 to June 1944, with almost three million men and women in uniform; 1.7 million of these were male soldiers, 1 million male Wehrmachtsbeamte and civilian employees, and almost 300,000 female and male auxiliaries (Luftwaffenhelfer).
The ''Luftwaffe'' had rendered invaluable support to the army, mopping up pockets of resistance.
The first steps towards the ''Luftwaffe''s formation were undertaken just months after Adolf Hitler came to power.
's Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces' heavy bomber raids by daylight on the German aviation industry, which catastrophically diminished the Third Reich's overall aviation production capacity later in World War II.
The failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons.
The merging of all military aviation organizations in the RLM took place on 15 May 1933, which became the ''Luftwaffe''s official 'birthday'.
The German aviation production reached about 36,000 combat aircraft for 1944.
However, Raeder and the Navy failed to press for naval air power until the war began, mitigating the ''Luftwaffe''s responsibility.
However Göring, as a part of Hitler's inner circle, was to provide enormously important access to financial assets and ''materiel'' for rearming and equipping the ''Luftwaffe''.
The buildup of the ''Jagdwaffe'' (Fighter Force) was too rapid and its quality suffered.
This led to the 53.7 litre displacement BMW 802 in 1943, an eighteen-cylinder air-cooled radial, and the even larger, 83.5 litre displacement BMW 803 28-cylinder liquid-cooled radial.
Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have an air force, German pilots trained in violation of the treaty in secret.
Udet merely conveyed the OKL's own dive-bombing capability request to Ernst Heinkel concerning the He 177, who vehemently opposed such an idea, which ruined its development as a heavy bomber.
During the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base.
Knauss promoted the Giulio Douhet theory that air power could win wars alone by destroying enemy industry and morale by "terrorizing the population" of major cities.
This led to Ernst Udet championing the dive-bomber, particularly the Junkers Ju 87.
In the proposal, it concluded, "The mission of the ''Luftwaffe'' is to serve these goals."
A further five ''Zerstörergruppen'' ("Destroyer groups") were created (JGr 101, 102,126,152 and 176), all equipped with the Bf 110.
The defeats at the Battle of Stalingrad and Battle of Kursk ensured the gradual decline of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front.
The manual directed the OKL to focus on limited operations (not strategic-operations); the protection of specific areas and support of the army in combat.
Of the nine ''Jagdgeschwader'' fighter wings in existence in 1939, no further units were formed until 1942, and the years of 1940–1941 were wasted.
Later, fighter pilot leaders were few in numbers as a result of this.
85 night fighter pilots, including 14 crew members, were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
After the mobilization in 1939 almost 900 000 men served, and just before Operation Barbarossa in 1941 the personnel strength had reached 1,5 million men.
Command and control problems were experienced, but owing to the flexibility and improvisation of both the army and ''Luftwaffe'', these problems were solved.
Meanwhile, the ''Luftwaffe'' continued to defend German-occupied Europe against the growing offensive power of RAF Bomber Command and, starting in the summer of 1942, the steadily building strength of the United States Army Air Forces.
Felmy concluded it was not possible until bases in Belgium and the Netherlands were obtained and the ''Luftwaffe'' had heavy bombers.
Throughout the history of the Third Reich, the ''Luftwaffe'' had only two commanders-in-chief.
Production of fighters was not given priority until 1944; Adolf Galland commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier.
''Generalfeldmarschall'' Erhard Milch was to assist Ernst Udet with aircraft production increases and introduction of more modern types of fighter aircraft.
It is relatively certain that 2,500 German fighter pilots attained ace status, having achieved at least 5 aerial victories.
''Luftflotten'' were also responsible for the training aircraft and schools in their operational areas.
Even with such dismal degrees of success for such advanced aviation powerplant designs, more and more design proposals for new German combat aircraft in the 1943–45 period centered either around the failed Jumo 222 or HeS 011 aviation powerplants for their propulsion.
Even a ''Leutnant'' (second lieutenant) could find himself commanding a ''Staffel''.
The German air power theorists continued to develop strategic theories, but emphasis was given to army support, as Germany was a continental power and expected to face ground operations following any declaration of hostilities.
The failure of German production was evident from the start of the Battle of Britain.
It was rumoured that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment.
Erhard Milch's reforms expanded production rates.
After the ''Bodenplatte'' effort, the ''Luftwaffe'' ceased to be an effective fighting force.
Wilberg was to play a large role in the development of German air doctrine.
The early-war twin-engined Heinkel He 115 floatplane and Dornier Do 18 flying boat were too slow and short-ranged, with the then-contemporary Blohm & Voss BV 138 trimotor flying boat becoming the ''Luftwaffe''s primary seaborne maritime patrol platform, with nearly 300 examples built and capable of up to a 4,300&nbsp;km (2,670&nbsp;mi) range from its trio of Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines.
Only the twinned-up Daimler-Benz DB 601-based, 1,750&nbsp;kW output "power system" designated the DB 606 (with its inherent "twin-crankcase" coupled engine design), and its more powerful descendant, the 2,130&nbsp;kW output DB 605-based DB 610, each of some 1.5 tonnes weight apiece seeing production were ever produced for front-line aircraft, most notably for the troublesome Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber, with the strictly experimental, approximately 1.8-tonne weight apiece, twinned-Daimler-Benz DB 603-based DB 613, capable of over 2,570&nbsp;kW output, never leaving its testing phase.
This base was officially known as 4th squadron of the 40th wing of the Red Army.
With rapidly  dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined Wehrmacht military forces as a whole, the ''Luftwaffe'' ceased to be an effective fighting force and after the defeat of the Third Reich, the ''Luftwaffe'' was disbanded in 1946.
A ''Geschwader'' consisted of groups (''Gruppen''), which in turn consisted of ''Jagdstaffel'' (fighter squadrons).
Nevertheless, this civilian transport was adapted for the long-range reconnaissance and anti-shipping roles and, between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 Grt.
At the start of the war the ''Luftwaffe'' had four ''Luftflotten'' ("air fleets"), each responsible for roughly a quarter of Germany.
Wilberg remained in the air staff and helped draw up the principle doctrine "The Conduct of the Aerial War" and its "Regulation 16" under Walther Wever.
One of the forerunners of the ''Luftwaffe'', the Imperial German Army Air Service, was founded in 1910 with the name ''Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches'', most often shortened to ''Fliegertruppe''.
In December 1934, Chief of the ''Luftwaffe'' General Staff Walther Wever sought to mould the ''Luftwaffe''s battle doctrine into a strategic plan.
Despite this Udet was appointed to and helped change the ''Luftwaffe''s tactical direction towards producing fast medium bombers that were to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production.
The ''Luftwaffe''s Condor Legion fought during the Spanish Civil War, the conflict became a testing ground for new doctrines and aircraft.
The greatest failure for the ''Kampfgeschwader'', however, was being saddled with an aircraft intended to be as big and as apparently capable as any Allied four-engined "heavy bomber" – the perpetually troubled Heinkel He 177, condemned through being designed to carry out moderate angle dive bombing missions from the day that the RLM accepted it for production in November 1937, so making it overweight from the start, and mandating design features that meant its "welded-together engines", a pair of cumbersome, 1.5 tonnes-apiece Daimler-Benz DB 606 "power systems", were prone to catch fire in flight during operational missions over both the Eastern Front and the United Kingdom.
At this time, Wever conducted war games (simulated against the French) in a bid to establish his theory of a strategic bombing force that would, he thought, prove decisive by winning the war through the destruction of enemy industry, even though these exercises also included tactical strikes against enemy ground forces and communications.
Throughout the war civilians or prisoners were used as human guinea pigs in testing ''Luftwaffe'' equipment.
The strength of ''Geschwader'' was about 80 – 90 aircraft.
The United Kingdom presented greater problems.
The "peripheral" strategy of the ''Luftwaffe'' between 1939 and 1940 had been to deploy its fighter defences at the edges of Axis occupied territory, with little protecting the inner depths.
General Felmy had already expressed a desire to build a naval air arm to support ''Kriegsmarine'' operations in the Atlantic and British waters.
That's roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids".
Freezing/hypothermia experiments were conducted for the Nazi high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the Eastern Front, as the German forces were ill-prepared for the cold weather they encountered.
The RLM was in charge of development and production of aircraft, and soon afterwards the test site or ''Erprobungsstelle'' at Rechlin became its testing ground, a military airfield that had been first established in August 1918.
The weight was increased from seven to twelve tons.
Hundreds of ''Luftwaffe'' pilots and technical personnel visited, studied and were trained at Soviet air force schools in several locations in Central Russia.
Until 1935, the 1926 manual "Directives for the Conduct of the Operational Air War" continued to act as the main guide for German air operations.
On the front-line combat side of the issue, and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the ''Luftwaffe''s warplanes, the ''Luftwaffe'' did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities, or ''Erprobungstellen'' located at three coastal sites – Peenemünde-West (also incorporating a separate facility in nearby Karlshagen), Tarnewitz and Travemünde – and the central inland site of Rechlin, itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire, with the four-facility system commanded later in World War II by ''Oberst'' (Colonel) Edgar Petersen.
However, Göring defied the sentence and committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide.
Moreover, no plans were laid for night fighters.
103 German fighter pilots shot down more than 100 enemy aircraft for a total of roughly 15,400 aerial victories.
During the Battle of Britain, the ''Luftwaffe'', despite causing severe damage to the Royal Air Force's infrastructure and British cities during the subsequent Blitz, did not achieve the air superiority that Hitler demanded for ''Operation Sea Lion'' as the invasion was cancelled in December 1940, when Hitler ordered preparations to be made for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.
However, they explained at a meeting of the Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next generation aircraft had failed to materialise, and obsolescent types had to be continued to keep up with the growing need for replacements.
The German rearmament program faced difficulties acquiring raw materials.
For these reasons, between 1933 and 1934, the ''Luftwaffe''s leadership was primarily concerned with tactical and operational methods.
Over 20,000 German airmen gained combat experience that would give the ''Luftwaffe'' an important advantage going into the Second World War.
These achievements were honored with 453 German day and ''Zerstörer'' (destroyer) pilots having received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
This led to a rush on the part of the RLM to produce the Junkers Ju 86, Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 before a proper evaluation was made.
Due to a lack of Strategic bombers – the very "Ural bombers" that General Wever had asked for six years before – the ''Luftwaffe'' could not strike at Soviet production centers regularly or with the needed force.
Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the ''Luftwaffe''s main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces.
Göring had little knowledge of current aviation, had last flown in 1922, and had not kept himself informed of latest events.
The RLM did have its own ''Technisches Amt'' (T-Amt) department to handle aviation technology issues, but this was tasked with handling all aviation technology issues in the Third Reich, both military and civilian in nature, and also not known to have ever had any clear and actively administrative and consultative links with the front-line forces established for such purposes.
Each ''Gruppe'' was commanded by a ''Kommandeur'', and a ''Staffel'' by a ''Staffelkapitän''.
In fact German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940.
The bomber arm was given preference and received the "better" pilots.
In April 1936, Wever ordered a requirement for what was termed the 'Bomber A' design competition, which would have a range of 6,700&nbsp;km (4,163&nbsp;mi) with a 900&nbsp;kg (1,984&nbsp;lb) bomb load.
Aircraft strength was 4,201 operational aircraft; 1,191 bombers, 361 dive bombers, 788 fighters, 431 heavy fighters, and 488 transports.
The ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to improvise and construct its defences during the war.
However, Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminium, which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force: given these circumstances, the ''Luftwaffe''s reliance on tactical mid-range, twin engined medium bombers and short range dive-bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy.
By the winter of 1941–42 just 39% of the fighter force was operational and possessed just 60 more combat aircraft than it did in June 1941 despite its increased commitments.
By 1939 the ''Luftwaffe'' was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign, with fatal results during the Battle of Britain.
The ''Luftwaffe'' thus lacked a cadre of staff officers to set up, man, and pass on experience.
# Crimes against humanity
During the Polish Campaign that triggered the war, it established air superiority, and then air supremacy, quickly.
The development of aircraft was now confined to the production of twin-engined medium bombers that required much less material, manpower and aviation production capacity than Wever's 'Ural Bombers'.
Göring was not able to rescind the dive bombing requirement for the He 177A until September 1942.
Hitler in particular wanted the defence to rest on anti-aircraft artillery as it gave the civilian population a "psychological crutch" no matter how ineffective the weapons.
Moreover, the front line units in the West were complaining about the poor numbers and performance of aircraft.
Wever began planning for a strategic bomber force and sought to incorporate strategic bombing into a war strategy.
Kesselring also had to contend with Göring appointing "yes men" to positions of importance.
A last-ditch effort to win air superiority was launched in January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, and met with failure.
The Commander-in-Chief left the organisation and building of the ''Luftwaffe'', after 1936, to Erhard Milch.
In the summer of 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' contributed to the unexpected success in the Battle of France.
# Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace
Training of formation leaders was not systematic until 1943, which was far too late, with the ''Luftwaffe'' already stretched.
In March 1938, as the ''Anschluss'' was taking place, Göring ordered Felmy to investigate the prospect of air raids against Britain.
This lack of understanding between the Flak and flying branches of the defence would plague the ''Luftwaffe'' throughout the war.
Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia.
''Fallschirmjäger'' formations were then used as crack foot infantry in all theatres of the war.
Göring decided not to report the facts to Hitler hoping that a surprise attack will quickly destroy Russia.
By the summer of 1939, the ''Luftwaffe'' had twenty-eight ''Geschwaders'' (wings).
As the largest-displacement inverted V12 aircraft powerplant built in Germany, the 44.52 litre (2,717 cu.
Galland also points to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the Me 262 jet – which included the protracted development time required for its Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines to improve their reliability.
Hermann Göring, a World War I ace with 22 victories and the holder of the ''Orden Pour le Mérite'', became National Kommissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa director Erhard Milch as his deputy.
Other officers promoted to the second highest military rank in Germany were Albert Kesselring, Hugo Sperrle, Erhard Milch, and Wolfram von Richthofen.
Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket propelled aircraft for bomber destroyer duties, it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel.
In April 1933 the ''Reichsluftfahrtministerium'' (RLM—Reich Air Ministry) was established.
The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor airliner's airframe – engineered for civilian airliner use – led to its lack of structural integrity for combat maneuvering at lower altitudes, making it unsuitable for use as a bomber, lacking speed, armour and bomb load capacity, sometimes with the fuselage literally "breaking its back" or a wing panel dropping loose from the wing root after a hard landing.
Despite the participation of these aircraft (mainly from 1938 onward), it was the venerable Junkers Ju 52 (which soon became the backbone of the ''Transportgruppen'') that made the main contribution.
The Dornier Do 217 would have been ideal, but suffered production problems.
In terms of fighter aircraft production, the British exceeded their production plans by 43%, while the Germans remained 40% "behind" target by the summer 1940.
Losses on the other hand were very high as well.
He died in Munich in 1953.
With an effective tactical-operational concept, the German air power theorists needed a strategic doctrine and organisation.
The failure of the ''Luftwaffe'' in the Defence of the Reich campaign was a result of a number of factors.
Despite the tactical victories won, they failed to achieve a decisive victory.
Initially, civil aviation schools within Germany were used, yet only light trainers could be used in order to maintain the façade that the trainees were going to fly with civil airlines such as Deutsche Luft Hansa.
In May 1934, Wever initiated a seven-year project for the "Ural Bomber", the bomber that would take the ''Luftwaffe''s bombing campaign into the heart of the Soviet Union.
However the intensification of Allied bombing caused the dispersion of production and prevented an efficient acceleration of expansion.
The appointment of Albert Speer as Minister of Armaments increased production of existing designs, and the few new designs that had originated from earlier in the war.
As with the late shift to fighter production, the ''Luftwaffe'' pilot schools did not give the fighter pilot schools preference soon enough.
Sperrle was prosecuted at the OKW Trial, one of the last twelve of the Nuremberg Trials after the war.
Udet's drinking and psychological condition became a problem, but Göring used Udet's dependency to manipulate him.
Fortunately it mattered little, as war was avoided by the Munich Agreement, and the need for long-range aircraft did not arise.
Milch's planned production increases were initially opposed.
Approximately 100 people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments.
It might also be argued that the ''Luftwaffe''s ''Kampfgeschwader'' medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets, but the lack of capable long range escort fighters — which, in most respects, were what the ''Zerstörer'' heavy fighters were meant to be — left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well organised fighter opposition.
Göring remarked, "the ''Führer'' will not ask how big the bombers there are, but only how many there are".
The following spring, the ''Luftwaffe'' helped its Axis partner, Italy secure victory in the Balkans Campaign and continued to support the Italians in the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres until May 1945.
