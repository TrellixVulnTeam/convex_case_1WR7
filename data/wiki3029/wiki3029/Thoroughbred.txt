It was then that handicapping, a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures, began to be used.
Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs, including Germany, Russia, Poland, and Hungary.
This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.
Although horse racing is hazardous, veterinary science has advanced.
The mares used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds, some of which, such as the Irish Hobby, had developed in northern Europe prior to the 13th&nbsp;century.
Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal.
The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s, when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $1 million.
However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds.
One genetic study indicates that 95% of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line (via the Y chromosome) to the Darley Arabian.
One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems, including fractures.
The first Thoroughbred horse in the American Colonies was Bulle Rock, imported in 1730.
The 19th&nbsp;century researcher Bruce Lowe identified 50&nbsp;mare "families" in the Thoroughbred breed, later augmented by other researchers to 74.
These artificial dates have been set to enable the standardization of races and other competitions for horses in certain age groups.
However, that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece.
All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century, and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding.
They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well.
During the American Revolution importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty.
The largest numbers are registered in the states of Kentucky, Florida and California.
The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred.
However, in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees, most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian (13.8%) than to the Darley Arabian (6.5%) when all lines of descent (maternal and paternal) are considered.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century.
In addition to racing, Thoroughbreds compete in eventing, show jumping and dressage at the highest levels of international competition, including the Olympics.
The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only 27 or 28 stallions from the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries.
The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is ''purebred''.
Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various Warmblood breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities.
The act was not repealed until 1949, after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book.
Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size:  the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3&nbsp;hands high.
Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds, with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass, which contributes to foot soreness, the most common source of lameness in racehorses.
Concern exists that the closed stud book and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of the level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population.
One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks, and one of the first tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004–05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation.
Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects what they have been bred to do.
While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's "bed rest" because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion.
By 1810, the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney, and by 1825 the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there.
Recent studies of the mtDNA of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor; in 19&nbsp;mare lines studied, the haplotypes revealed that they traced to only 15&nbsp;unique foundation mares, suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB.
Up until the end of the 19th century, Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses.
Poor breeding may be encouraged by the fact that many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury.
In Australia, there were 31,416 horses in training during 2007, and those horses started 194,066 times for A$375,512,579 of prize money.
Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting.
Both of these horses were sons of Boston, a descendant of Sir Archy.
Studies have shown that track surfaces, horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal medications, and high-intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate.
Sprinters are usually well muscled, while ''stayers'', or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer.
One took place in 1823, in Long Island, New York, between Sir Henry and American Eclipse.
Averages, however, can be deceiving.
Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, laminitis, and other infections.
The ''French Stud Book'' was founded at the same time by the government.
On the other hand, advocates of racing argue that without horse racing, far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses.
Throughout the 1830s, the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds, almost exclusively for racing purposes, and to improve the local stock.
An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing, but also for steeplechasing.
White is very rare, but is a recognized color separate from gray.
Stud fees for stallions that enter breeding can range from $2,500 to $500,000 per mare in the United States, and from ₤2000 pounds to £75,000 pounds or more in Britain.
If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation.
These included the Alcock's Arabian,  D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb.
In 2007, Keeneland Sales, a United States-based sales company, sold 9,124 horses at auction, with a total value of $814,401,000, which gives an average price of $89,259.
Also in 2007, Doncaster Bloodstock Sales, another British sales firm, sold 2,248 horses for a total value of 43,033,881 guineas, making an average of 15,110 guineas per horse.
Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of Federico Tesio, who started his breeding program in 1898.
They have been influential on many modern breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, the Standardbred, and possibly the Morgan, a breed that went on to influence many of the gaited breeds in North America.
He was retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents.
The number of Thoroughbred foals registered each year in North America varies greatly, chiefly linked to the success of the auction market which in turn depends on the state of the economy.
According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30&nbsp;foundation animals, 27 of which are male.
Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages.

During 2007, in Japan, there were 23,859 horses in training and those horses started 182,614 times for A$857,446,268 of prize money.
This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a mid-grade runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil.
Iroquois became the first American-bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881.
Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion, and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years, fourteen of them in a row.
Current estimates indicate that there are 1.5 career-ending breakdowns for every 1,000 horses starting a race in the United States, an average of two horses per day.
The Argentine Stud Book was first published in 1893.
Further, as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines, Curwen's Bay Barb (4.2%) appears more often than the Byerley Turk (3.3%).
According to Peter Willett, about 50% of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines, with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding.
A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, particularly in the United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature.
The 1,000&nbsp;Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to fillies, but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years.
One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping.
The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed, though often not capitalized, especially in non-specialist publications, and outside the US.
The last major match races before the American Civil War were both between Lexington and Lecompte.
Good-quality Thoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head on a long neck, high withers, a deep chest, a short back, good depth of hindquarters, a lean body, and long legs.
The distances of these races, ranging from  to , led to a change in breeding practices, as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed.
Other mares were of oriental breeding, including Barb, Turk and other bloodlines, although most researchers conclude that the number of Eastern mares imported into England during the 100 years after 1660 was small.
The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness, generating around $34&nbsp;billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about 470,000&nbsp;jobs through a network of farms, training centers and race tracks.
Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible.
This development meant a change in breeding practices, as well as the age that horses were raced, with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore.
Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for racing, the breed is also used for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses.
Famous match races held in the early 19th&nbsp;century helped popularize horse racing in the United States.
The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse.

The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing.
Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible.
Each of the three major foundation sires was, coincidentally, the ancestor of a grandson or great-great-grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse's male line: Matchem was the only descendant of his grandsire, the Godolphin Arabian, to maintain a male line to the present; the Byerley Turk's male line was preserved by Herod (or King Herod), a great-great-grandson; and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great-great-grandson Eclipse, who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated.

For example, the Australian Stud Book, ''The New York Times'', and the BBC do not capitalize the word.
Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the Middle Ages and into the reign of King James I of England.
While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's General Stud Book was one of the first breed registries created, in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a ''thoroughbred'' except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed.
The line that a horse comes is a critical factor in determing the price for a young horse.

Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not necessarily reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The Green Monkey, injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race.
Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the 1840s and 1850s, with the first direct importation from England occurring in 1862.

Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16.2 hands, down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1, the best racehorses are generally of average size.
Nonetheless, breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably, though ''thoroughbred'' is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species.
The typical Thoroughbred ranges from  high, averaging .
Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness.
The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines, whether Arabian, Barb, or Turk, to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses.

Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside the British Isles.
Gradually, the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization, now known as the Australian Racing Board.
It  prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book (GSB)  if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB.
Other countries report lower rates of injury, with the United Kingdom having 0.9 injuries/1,000 starts (1990–1999) and the courses in Victoria, Australia, producing a rate of 0.44 injuries/1,000 starts (1989–2004).

Devoted exclusively to the sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.
Although the word ''thoroughbred'' is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed.
The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover.
With royal support, horse racing became popular with the public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted to racing, the ''Racing Calendar'', was founded.
