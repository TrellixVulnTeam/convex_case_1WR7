This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers.
Despite repeated publication of the Indexes and a large bureaucracy of censors, the activities of the Inquisition did not impede the flowering of Spanish literature's "Siglo de Oro", although almost all of its major authors crossed paths with the Holy Office at one point or another.
The Inquisitor General presided over the Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition (generally abbreviated as "Council of the Suprema"), created in 1483, which was made up of six members named directly by the crown (the number of members of the Suprema varied over the course of the Inquisition's history, but it was never more than 10).
The first two inquisitors, Miguel de Morillo and Juan de San Martín, were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in Medina del Campo.
The Inquisitor General was the only public office whose authority stretched to all the kingdoms of Spain (including the American viceroyalties), except for a brief period (1507–1518) during which there were two Inquisitors General, one in the kingdom of Castile, and the other in Aragon.
In 1609, King Philip III, upon the advice of his financial adviser the Duke of Lerma and Archbishop of Valencia Juan de Ribera, decreed the Expulsion of the Moriscos.
The Marvel Comics series ''Marvel 1602'' shows the Inquisition targeting Mutants for "blasphemy".
Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals and horse smugglers.
The Spanish inquisition, however, engaged in it far less often and with greater care than other courts.
Sixtus did so on 17 October 1483, naming Tomás de Torquemada Inquisidor General of Aragón, Valencia, and Catalonia.
In the reign of Philip V, there were 125 ''autos-da-fé'', while in the reigns of Charles III and Charles IV only 44.
# The defendant could be '''reconciled'''.
The morning sessions were devoted to questions of faith, while the afternoons were reserved for "minor heresies" cases of perceived unacceptable sexual behavior, bigamy, witchcraft, etc.
# The trial could be '''suspended''', in which case the defendant, although under suspicion, went free (with the threat that the process could be continued at any time) or was held in long-term imprisonment until a trial commenced.
The "Spanish Inquisition" may be defined broadly, operating "in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, and all Spanish possessions in North, Central, and South America."
Though the pope wanted to crack down on abuses, Ferdinand pressured him to promulgate a new bull, threatening that he would otherwise separate the Inquisition from Church authority.
This loss of influence can also be explained because the foreign Enlightenment texts entered the peninsula through prominent members of the nobility or government, influential people with whom it was very difficult to interfere.
The Alhambra Decree that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on 16 December 1968.
This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them.
The ''auto-da-fé'' involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.
The first Index published in Spain in 1551 was, in reality, a reprinting of the Index published by the University of Leuven in 1550, with an appendix dedicated to Spanish texts.
However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of ''conversos'' was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for formally expelling all Jews from Spain was the "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., ''conversos'') from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith".
The "Black Legend", a term associated with scholar Julian Juderias, developed significantly, in his view, from the approach of considering the Inquisition's persecutions.
On the other hand, the perennial struggle between the power of the throne and the power of the Church, inclined more and more to the former, under which, Enlightenment thinkers found better protection for their ideas.
Historian Henry Kamen contends that some "popular" accounts of the inquisition (those that describe scenes of uncontrolled sadistic torture) are not based in truth.
This penalty was frequently applied to impenitent heretics and those who had relapsed.
The 1568–1570 Morisco Revolt in Granada was harshly suppressed, and the Inquisition intensified its attention to the Moriscos.
According to García Cárcel, the court of Valencia employed the death penalty in 40% of the processings before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%).
However, according to Kamen, the Jews of the kingdom of Aragon went "to adjacent Christian lands, mainly to Italy", rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed.
19th-century literature tends to focus on the element of torture employed by the Inquisition.
A number of ''autos-da-fé'' were held, some of them presided over by members of the royal family, and around 100 executions took place.
Denunciations were made for a variety of reasons, from genuine concern, to rivalries and personal jealousies.
Yes, you read that correctly.
This was one of the points most criticized by those who opposed the Inquisition (for example, the Cortes of Castile, in 1518).
There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in Quintanar de la Orden in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century.
Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics".
The character Magneto also appears as the Grand Inquisitor.
The Indexes included an enormous number of books of all types, though special attention was dedicated to religious works, and, particularly, vernacular translations of the Bible.
The witch-hunt in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany).
They were called ''Edicts of Grace'' because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a ''period of grace'' (usually ranging from thirty to forty days) were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.
This saying passed into common usage in Spain.
Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities.
On 26 July 1826 the "Meetings of Faith" Congregation condemned and executed the school teacher Cayetano Ripoll, who thus became the last person known to be executed by the Inquisition.
An Inquisition edict of December 1789, that received the full approval of Charles IV and Floridablanca, stated that:
Different sources give different estimates of the number of trials and executions in this period; Henry Kamen estimates about 2,000 executed, based on the documentation of the ''autos-da-fé'', the great majority being ''conversos'' of Jewish origin.
Finally, on 15 July 1834, the Spanish Inquisition was definitively abolished by a Royal Decree signed by regent Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, Ferdinand VII's liberal widow, during the minority of Isabella II and with the approval of the President of the Cabinet Francisco Martínez de la Rosa.
In 1504 an accused stated, "only the rich were burnt".
* 1482 In Seville and in Córdoba.
Detention of the accused entailed the preventive sequestration of their property by the Inquisition.
Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional laws and customs in domestic matters.
On that day, Ripoll was hanged in Valencia, for having taught deist principles.
Nevertheless, it is likely that the toll was higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García Cárcel for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively.
He then instituted a purge during which Spaniards could be arrested on the charge of being "suspected of Freemasonry".
The Alhambra Decree, issued in January 1492, ordered the expulsion.
According to authorities within the Eastern Orthodox Church, there was at least one casualty tortured by those "Jesuits" (though most likely, Franciscans) who administered the Spanish Inquisition in North America:  St. Peter the Aleut.
Castile itself had an unofficial rabbi.
Among the "litany of complaints" against Juan de Mañozca—who was one of the first inquisitors of Cartagena, Colombia in 1609 and made chief inquisitor of Mexico in 1643—was that he "made a habit of hauling market traders before him and a colleague and seizing whatever took their fancy, throwing them into the inquisitorial jail if they did not comply."
This material, however, is far from being complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no ''relaciones de causas'' from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid).
The inquisitorial process consisted of a series of hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony.
From 1570 Morisco cases became predominant in the tribunals of Zaragoza, Valencia and Granada; in the tribunal of Granada, between 1560 and 1571, 82% of those accused were Moriscos, who were a vast majority of the Kingdom's population at the time.
Starting in the 1920s, Jewish scholars picked up where Lea's work left off.
Modern estimates, based on careful examination of official documents and population estimates of communities, are much lower: Henry Kamen estimates that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 ''conversos'', about 40,000 chose emigration.
Kamen argues that torture was only ever used to elicit information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.
By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous practice of Islam is considered to have been effectively extinguished in Spain.
In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis.
Since the Inquisition itself was an arm of the state, being within the Council of Castile, civil rather than ecclesiastical censorship usually prevailed.
In 1483, Ferdinand and Isabella established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar Tomás de Torquemada acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in Aragon and its treatment of the ''conversos''.
It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within the long history of the Inquisition.
They published Yitzhak Baer's ''History of the Jews in Christian Spain'', Cecil Roth's ''History of the Marranos'' and, after World War II, the work of Haim Beinart, who for the first time published trial transcripts of cases involving conversos.
The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.
A report, produced by Pedro González de Mendoza, Archbishop of Seville, and by the Segovian Dominican Tomás de Torquemada, corroborated this assertion.
"They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred.
Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen, most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion, rather than as a sincere change of faith.
In the case of men, the penalty was five years service as an oarsman in a royal galley (possibly a death sentence).
The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the abolition of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them Olavide, in 1776; Iriarte, in 1779; and Jovellanos, in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them:
Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to "relieve their consciences".
In the first place, the state stopped being a mere social organizer and began to worry about the well-being of the public.
After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492.
Only a handful of the more principal persons of the Jewish community managed to escape, who had found refuge among the viceroys in the outlying towns and districts.
Crypto-Jews were allowed to confess and do penance, although those who relapsed were burned at the stake.
Juan Antonio Llorente, who had been the Inquisition's general secretary in 1789, became a Bonapartist and published a critical history in 1817 from his French exile, based on his privileged access to its archives.
Spanish Inquisition records reveal two prosecutions in Spain and only a few more throughout the Spanish Empire.
Those who avoided expulsion or who managed to return were gradually absorbed by the dominant culture.
As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years.
By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: Ávila, Córdoba, Jaén, Medina del Campo, Segovia, Sigüenza, Toledo, and Valladolid.
He offers striking statistics: 91.6% of those judged in Valencia between 1484 and 1530 and 99.3% of those judged in Barcelona between 1484 and 1505 were of Jewish origin.
In the first half of the 18th century, 111 were condemned to be burned in person, and 117 in effigy, most of them for judaizing.
The prosecution was directed by the ''fiscal''.
In 1480 a plot to overthrow the government of Seville under armed insurrection lead by Don Diego de Susona, a wealthy merchant converso was discovered and suppressed.
12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape, did they have a chance to avoid punishment altogether.
When a butcher in a house next door to Mañozca's disturbed him by killing a pig, Mañozca had the butcher's butler and servants arrested and interned in the inquisitorial jail.
The fight from within against the Inquisition was almost always clandestine.
This execution occurred against the backdrop of a European-wide scandal concerning the despotic attitudes still prevailing in Spain.
Jean-Pierre Dedieu has studied those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy.
In addition to the public ceremony in which the condemned was reconciled with the Catholic Church, more severe punishments were used, among them long sentences to jail or the galleys, plus the confiscation of all property.
During the reign of Charles IV of Spain, in spite of the fears that the French Revolution provoked, several events took place that accelerated the decline of the Inquisition.
During the Carlist Wars it was the conservatives who fought the liberals who wanted to reduce the Church's power, amongst other reforms to liberalize the economy.
Also, many cases of solicitation during confession were adjudicated, indicating a strict vigilance over the clergy.
''Autos-da-fé'' also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them.
Women too were accused of bigamy.
* 1488 In Valladolid and in Murcia.
Well after the foundation of the inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.
In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%).
However, the murder of ''Inquisidor'' Pedro Arbués in Zaragoza on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the ''conversos'' and in favour of the Inquisition.
Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians, such as Henry Kamen, argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed.
The last public ''auto-da-fé'' took place in 1691.
Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure.
To become a ''familiar'' was considered an honour, since it was a public recognition of ''limpieza de sangre'' — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges.
Also, members of the clergy itself were occasionally accused of heretical propositions.
Torquemada quickly established procedures for the Inquisition.
Although many nobles held the position, most of the ''familiares'' came from the ranks of commoners.
In the Americas, tribunals were established in Lima and in Mexico City (1569) and, in 1610, in Cartagena de Indias (present day Colombia).
Although the Inquisition was technically forbidden from permanently harming or drawing blood, this still allowed several methods of torture.
García Cárcel estimates that the total number processed by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions that appeared in the trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death.
The 19th-century professional historians, including the Spanish scholar Amador de los Rios, were the first to challenge this perception and look seriously at the role of Jews and Muslims.
The Jews, who had previously thrived under Muslim rule, now suffered similar maltreatment.
Challenging some of the claims of revisionist historians is Toby Green in ''Inquisition, the Reign of Fear'', who calls the claim by revisionists that torture was only rarely applied by inquisitors, a "worrying error of fact".
But the Inquisition was reconstituted when Ferdinand VII recovered the throne on 1 July 1814.
Members of the episcopate were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors.
Over time, the authority of the Suprema grew at the expense of the power of the Inquisitor General.
In the second half of the century, late in the reign of Philip II, conditions worsened between Old Christians and Moriscos.
At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published in the first place if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index?
As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: "Our country is a land of ... barbarism; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of heresy, error and Judaism.
The ''fiscal'' was in charge of presenting the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture.
However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and even saw revolt, as in Teruel from 1484 to 1485.
The second novel, ''Purity of Blood'', has the narrator being tortured by the Inquisition and describes an auto-da-fé.
It was applied mainly against those suspected of Judaism and Protestantism, beginning in the 16th century.
Possibly as a result of Llorente's criticisms, the Inquisition was once again temporarily abolished during the three-year Liberal interlude known as the Trienio liberal, but still the old system had not yet had its last gasp.
* 1574 In Santiago de Compostela.
Alonso de Hojeda, a Dominican friar from Seville, convinced Queen Isabella of the existence of Crypto-Judaism among Andalusian ''conversos'' during her stay in Seville between 1477 and 1478.
There was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in Castile.
"They burn only the well-off", said another.
In France, in the early 19th century, the epistolary novel ''Cornelia Bororquia, or the Victim of the Inquisition'', which has been attributed to Spaniard Luiz Gutiérrez, and is based on the case of María de Bohórquez, ferociously criticizes the Inquisition and its representatives.
According to Barrios, the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did not want to give her to Lucero, and so Lucero had the three of them burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept for a long time in the alcazar as a mistress.
According to Kamen, about 200 Spaniards were accused of being Protestants in the last decades of the 16th century.
Its old power no longer exists: the horrible authority that this bloodthirsty court had exerted in other times was reduced... the Holy Office had come to be a species of commission for book censorship, nothing more...
These ''conversos'' were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.
Although the vast majority of ''conversos'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree.
However, this conclusion is contested.
As with all European tribunals of the time, torture was employed.
The first Spanish ''auto-da-fé'' did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six of the men and women subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed.
The court employed physical torture to extract confessions.
In the first phase, numerous tribunals were established, but the period after 1495 saw a marked tendency towards centralization.
Ferdinand II of Aragon pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome.
So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of Lérida and Gironda and in the kingdom of  València had been affected, as were also the Jews of Al-Andalus (Andalucía), whereas many died a martyr’s death, while others converted in order to save themselves.
Still, according to Kamen, the Moriscos did not experience the same harshness as judaizing ''conversos'' and Protestants, and the number of capital punishments was proportionally less.
After 1562, though the trials continued, the repression was much reduced.
The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.
Most importantly, in the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon a large number of the Moriscos were under the jurisdiction of the nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class.
Valentin de Foronda published ''Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios'', a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons.
During the Middle Ages, in Castile, little attention was paid to heresy by the Catholic ruling class.
The rituals related to the ''auto'' began the previous night (the "procession of the Green Cross") and sometimes lasted the whole day.
Among these were ''sanbenito'', exile, fines or even sentencing to service as oarsmen in royal galleys.
Post-reconquest medieval Spain has been characterized by Americo Castro and some other Iberianists as a society of "convivencia", that is relatively peaceful co-existence, albeit punctuated by occasional conflict among the ruling Catholics and the Jews and Muslims.
These offences rarely led to severe penalties.
This is striking because both Charles I and Philip II were confessed admirers of Erasmus.
Such lists of prohibited books were common in Europe a decade before the Inquisition published its first.
Although initially the public ''autos'' did not have any special solemnity nor sought a large attendance of spectators, with time they became solemn ceremonies, celebrated with large public crowds, amidst a festive atmosphere.
According to Don Hasdai Crescas, persecution against Jews began in earnest in Seville in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June).
William H. Prescott, the Boston historian, likened the Inquisition to an "eye that never slumbered".
The Inquisition searched for false converts from Judaism among the ''conversos'', but also searched for false or relapsed converts among the Moriscos, forced converts from Islam.
In particular, there were trials for bigamy, a relatively frequent offence in a society that only permitted divorce under the most extreme circumstances.
Despite much popular myth about the Spanish Inquisition relating to Protestants, it dealt with very few cases involving actual Protestants, as there were so few in Spain.
In the kingdom of Castile, the following permanent tribunals of the Inquisition were established:
There were only four tribunals in the kingdom of Aragon: Zaragoza and Valencia (1482), Barcelona (1484), and Majorca (1488).
* 1485 In Toledo and in Llerena.
Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella requested a papal bull establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478 in response to the ''conversos'' returning to the practice of Judaism.
In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified.
"Most of them were in no sense Protestants...Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as 'Lutheran.'
"In 1482 the pope was still trying to maintain control over the Inquisition and to gain acceptance for his own attitude towards the New Christians, which was generally more moderate than that of the Inquisition and the local rulers."
''La Celestina'', which was not included in the Indexes of the 16th century, was expurgated in 1632 and prohibited in its entirety in 1790.
The first of the trials against those labeled by the Inquisition as "Lutheran" were those against the sect of mystics known as the "Alumbrados" of Guadalajara and Valladolid.
It is likely that between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.
The Inquisition was originally intended primarily to ensure the orthodoxy of those who converted from Judaism and Islam.
The Inquisition also pursued offences against morals, at times in open conflict with the jurisdictions of civil tribunals.
Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the crown of Aragon and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political.
Modern historians have begun to study the documentary records of the Inquisition.
Pope Sixtus IV granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors.
At the same time, during the Reconquista, Spain's anti-Jewish sentiment steadily increased.
A defense counsel was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth.
The category "superstitions" includes trials related to witchcraft.
The coast was regularly raided by Barbary pirates backed by Spain's enemy the Ottoman Empire, and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.
Of those permanently expelled, the majority finally settled in the Maghreb or the Barbary coast.
Samuel Shellabarger's ''Captain from Castile'' deals directly with the Spanish Inquisition during the first part of the novel.
At the start of the 20th century Henry Charles Lea published the groundbreaking ''History of the Inquisition in Spain''.
In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably.
During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly.
The ''potro'', the rack, was the instrument of torture used most frequently.
The Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of Isabella II, after a period of declining influence in the preceding century.
The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.
The ''alguacil'' was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant.
About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse.
Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed.
It challenges the view that most conversos were actually practicing Judaism in secret and were persecuted for their crypto-Judaism.
Ferdinand the Catholic also established the Spanish Inquisition in Sicily (1513), housed in Palermo and Sardinia, in the town of Sassari.
Before and during the 19th century historical interest focused on who was being persecuted.
Encouraged by the preaching of Ferrand Martinez, Archdeacon of Ecija, the general unrest affected nearly all of the Jews in Spain, during which time an estimated 200,000 Jews changed their religion or else concealed their religion, becoming known in Hebrew as "Anūsim," meaning, "those who are compelled to hide their religion."
Along similar lines is Edward Peters's ''Inquisition'' (1988).
The Spanish Inquisition had been established in part to prevent ''conversos'' from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, they were supposed to have given up.
The archives of the Suprema only provide information surrounding the processes prior to 1560.
