Each unit contains 16 bars, and is divided the same way: 4 bars, 3 bars, 2 bars, etc.
Already in the course of the 1980s, Cage's health worsened progressively: he suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis.
Cage conceived "a silent piece" years earlier, but was reluctant to write it down; and indeed, the premiere (given by Tudor on August 29, 1952 at Woodstock, New York) caused an uproar in the audience.
Instead of doing as they did, I went into the stacks and read the first book written by an author whose name began with Z. I received the highest grade in the class.
Finally, some of Cage's works, particularly those completed during the 1960s, feature instructions to the performer, rather than fully notated music.
In each instance the ''gamut'' was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony.
He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass.
In ''Imaginary Landscape No.
Subsequent books also featured different types of content, from lectures on music to poetry—Cage's mesostics.
By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting.
Cage's aesthetic position was criticized by, among others, prominent writer and critic Douglas Kahn.
Cage's first completed pieces are currently lost.
Cage had their ashes scattered in Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, and asked for the same to be done to him after his death.
While at Black Mountain College in 1952, he organized what has been called the first "happening" (see discussion below) in the United States, later titled ''Theatre Piece No.
Although Schoenberg was not impressed with Cage's compositional abilities during these two years, in a later interview, where he initially said that none of his American pupils were interesting, he further stated in reference to Cage: "There was one...of course he's not a composer, but he's an inventor—of genius."
The technique was elevated to great complexity in later pieces such as ''Sonatas and Interludes'' for prepared piano (1946–48), in which many proportions used non-integer numbers (1¼, ¾, 1¼, ¾, 1½, and 1½ for ''Sonata I'', for example), or ''A Flower'', a song for voice and closed piano, in which two sets of proportions are used simultaneously.
Nevertheless, he still played ''Cheap Imitation'' during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing.
These opportunities did not materialize.
Finally, the musical content of the piece is based on sixteen motives.
Although Cage was involved in relationships with Don Sample and with architect Rudolph Schindler's wife Pauline when he met Xenia, he fell in love immediately.
When I hear what we call music, it seems to me that someone is talking.
''Silence'' was Cage's first book.
After several months in Paris, Cage's enthusiasm for America was revived after he read Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass'' – he wanted to return immediately, but his parents, with whom he regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip, persuaded him to stay in Europe for a little longer and explore the continent.
Cunningham remained Cage's partner for the rest of his life.
Helmut Lachenmann's work was influenced by Cage's work with extended techniques.
Music in which some of the composition and/or performance is left to chance was labelled ''aleatoric music''—a term popularized by Pierre Boulez.
It was during that time that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments, such as household items, metal sheets, and so on.
Cage studied with Schoenberg in California: first at USC and then at UCLA, as well as privately.
Pierre Boulez, who used to promote Cage's work in Europe, was opposed to Cage's use of chance, and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s, e.g.
It was modeled on Cage's 1958 work 'Indeterminacy', in which Cage and then Jones, respectively, sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories they’d written.
''Cheap Imitation'' became the last work Cage performed in public himself.
Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition ''4′33″'', which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who present the work do nothing aside from being present for the duration specified by the title.
This was followed, the same year, by ''Seven Day Diary'', which Cage drew with his eyes closed, but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations.
In ''Inlets'' (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound.
Despite the fame ''Sonatas and Interludes'' earned him, and the connections he cultivated with American and European composers and musicians, Cage was quite poor.
That convinced me that the institution was not being run correctly.
It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the global such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage's infamous 1952 opus, ''4'33".''
"By being hushed and silent, he said, 'we should have the opportunity to hear what other people think'," anticipating ''4'33"'' by more than thirty years.
Several months later, still in 1933, Cage became sufficiently good at composition to approach Schoenberg.
The majority of his students had little or no background in music.
For example, in the case of ''Cheap Imitation'', the exact questions asked to the ''I Ching'' were these:
First he studied Gothic and Greek architecture, but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it.
Famous pieces that resulted from the classes include George Brecht's ''Time Table Music'' and Al Hansen's ''Alice Denham in 48 Seconds''.
Indeed, the two immediately established a strong bond upon meeting and began a working relationship that continued for several years.
4′33″, or his ''Landscapes'' for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music, they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artist's power.
In his 1999 book ''Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts'', Kahn acknowledged the influence Cage had on culture, but noted that "one of the central effects of Cage's battery of silencing techniques was a silencing of the social."
Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.
In 1979 Cage's ''Empty Words'' was first published by Wesleyan University Press.
Although Cage started painting in his youth, he gave it up in order to concentrate on music instead.
The two composers quickly became friends; some time later Cage, Feldman, Earle Brown, David Tudor and Cage's pupil Christian Wolff came to be referred to as "the New York school."
While much of Cage's work remains controversial, his influence on countless composers, artists, and writers is notable.
In 1988–1990 he produced watercolors at the Mountain Lake Workshop.
During this time, Cage pursued a macrobiotic diet.
4'' for 12 radio receivers, and ''Music of Changes'' for piano.
Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25-note rows.
To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with questions to ask the ''I Ching''; the book would then be used in much the same way as it is used for divination.
The title referred to the number of performers needed; the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints.
But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't have the feeling that anyone is talking.
The process of composition, in many of the later Number Pieces, was simple selection of pitch range and pitches from that range, using chance procedures; the music has been linked to Cage's anarchic leanings.
Cage's work as musicologist helped popularize Erik Satie's music, and his friendship with Abstract expressionist artists such as Robert Rauschenberg helped introduce his ideas into visual art.
''M'' was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973.
Brown befriended Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both.
Nevertheless, ever since arthritis started plaguing him, the composer was aware of his age, and, as biographer David Revill observed, "the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so long—the fire of passion—but also fire as transitoriness and fragility."
The first fruits of these studies were works inspired by Indian concepts: ''Sonatas and Interludes'' for prepared piano, ''String Quartet in Four Parts'', and others.
The Cornish School years proved to be a particularly important period in Cage's life.
After several months he left and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird at the Cornish College of the Arts.
Cage's pre-chance works, particularly pieces from the late 1940s such as ''Sonatas and Interludes'', earned critical acclaim: the ''Sonatas'' were performed at Carnegie Hall in 1949.
The reaction to ''4′33″'' was just a part of the larger picture: on the whole, it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cage's reputation.
The earliest project completed there was the etching ''Score Without Parts'' (1978), created from fully notated instructions, and based on various combinations of drawings by Henry David Thoreau.
The result, ''The City Wears a Slouch Hat'', was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow.
At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen.
The press, which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music, ignored his new works, and many valuable friendships and connections were lost.
Throughout his adult life, Cage was also active as lecturer and writer.
Cage met Kaprow while on a mushroom hunt with George Segal and invited him to join his class.
The latter was to become Cage's lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator.
The content of the composition is not "four minutes and 33 seconds of silence," as is often assumed, but rather the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance.
The score of ''0'00"'' (1962; also known as ''4'33" No.
In addition to Cage, the participants included Cunningham and Tudor.
Yet another series of works, the so-called ''Number Pieces'', all completed during the last five years of the composer's life, make use of ''time brackets'': the score consists of short fragments with indications of when to start and to end them (e.g.
Europeras I and II require greater forces than III, IV and V, which are on a chamber scale.
Cage would later adopt the "inventor" moniker and deny that he was in fact a composer.
Peters Corporation.
This concept was originally intended for a performance staged in a room too small to include a full percussion ensemble.
The performer combines the squares and uses lines and points as a coordinate system, in which the lines are axes of various characteristics of the sounds, such as lowest frequency, simplest overtone structure, etc.
In 1944–45 Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents: ''Crete'' and ''Dad''.
And I love the activity of sound ...
The composer's financial situation gradually improved: in late 1954 he and Tudor were able to embark on a European tour.
Prominent critics of serialism, such as the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, were similarly hostile towards Cage: for Xenakis, the adoption of chance in music was "an abuse of language and ... an abrogation of a composer's function."
''Concert for Piano and Orchestra'', ''Fontana Mix'' (both 1958)) present the performer with similar difficulties.
Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential American composers of the 20th century.
He received first piano lessons when he was in the fourth grade at school, but although he liked music, he expressed more interest in sight reading than in developing virtuoso piano technique, and apparently was not thinking of composition.
He graduated that year from Los Angeles High School as a valedictorian, having also in the spring given a prize-winning speech at the Hollywood Bowl proposing a day of quiet for all Americans.
When he said that, I revolted, not against him, but against what he had said.
# Which of the twelve possible chromatic transpositions am I using?
Cage taught at the college in the summers of 1948 and 1952 and was in residence the summer of 1953.
Radiohead undertook a composing and performing collaboration with Cunningham's dance troupe in 2003 because the music-group's leader Thom Yorke considered Cage one of his "all-time art heroes".
She was an Alaskan-born daughter of a Russian priest; her work encompassed fine bookbinding, sculpture and collage.
Cage and Kashevaroff were married in the desert at Yuma, Arizona, on June 7, 1935.
The first results of the new approach were ''Imaginary Landscape No.
Harrison soon helped Cage to secure a faculty member position at Mills College, teaching the same program as at UCLA, and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl.
Cage's work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change.
It premiered in Cologne, Germany, on September 19, 1992, accompanied by the live performance of the orchestra piece ''103''.
The score of ''Variations I'' (1958) presents the performer with six transparent squares, one with points of various sizes, five with five intersecting lines.
In 1960 the composer was appointed a Fellow on the faculty of the Center for Advanced Studies (now the Center for Humanities) in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wesleyan, where he started teaching classes in experimental music.
The Japanese composer Tōru Takemitsu has also cited Cage's influence.
According to his wishes, Cage's body was cremated, and the ashes scattered in the Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, New York, the same place where Cage scattered the ashes of his parents, years before.
from anywhere between 1′15″ and 1′45″, and to anywhere from 2′00″ to 2′30″).
The work comprises two lithographs and a group of what Cage called ''plexigrams'': silk screen printing on plexiglas panels.
He produced music for choreographies and at one point taught a course on "Musical Accompaniments for Rhythmic Expression" at UCLA, with his aunt Phoebe.
the ''I Ching'', to star charts: ''Atlas Eclipticalis'' (1961–62), and a series of etudes: ''Etudes Australes'' (1974–75), ''Freeman Etudes'' (1977–90), and ''Etudes Boreales'' (1978).
I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony.
In early 1946 Cage agreed to tutor Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the US to study Western music.
Through them, Cage met numerous important artists such as Piet Mondrian, André Breton, Jackson Pollock, Marcel Duchamp, and many others.
The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.
This version of the ''I Ching'' was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff's father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950.
He was taken to the nearest hospital, where he died on the morning of August 12.
In 1938, on Cowell's recommendation, Cage drove to San Francisco to find employment and to seek out fellow Cowell student and composer Lou Harrison.
Matters were complicated further by David Tudor's departure from performing, which happened in early 1970s.
Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.
Guggenheim was very supportive: the Cages could stay with her and Ernst for any length of time, and she offered to organize a concert of Cage's music at the opening of her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cage's percussion instruments from Chicago.
All of Cage's music since 1951 was composed using chance procedures, most commonly using the ''I Ching''.
And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships.
The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.
Other composers who adopted chance procedures in their works included Witold Lutosławski, Mauricio Kagel, and many others.
After a 1949 performance at Carnegie Hall, New York, Cage received a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which enabled him to make a trip to Europe, where he met composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez.
Merce Cunningham lived another 17 years, dying of natural causes in July 2009.
Cage's adoption of chance operations in 1951 cost him a number of friendships and led to numerous criticisms from fellow composers.
Cage enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont as a theology major in 1928.
I don't need sound to talk to me.
the eleventh piece for a single performer), completed in early 1992, was Cage's first and only foray into film.
In the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with C.F.
Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses.
In another example of late music by Cage, ''Etudes Australes'', the compositional procedure involved placing a transparent strip on the star chart, identifying the pitches from the chart, transferring them to paper, then asking the ''I Ching'' which of these pitches were to remain single, and which should become parts of aggregates (chords), and the aggregates were selected from a table of some 550 possible aggregates, compiled beforehand.
On August 11, 1992, while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham, Cage suffered another stroke.
Following Cowell's advice, Cage travelled to New York City in 1933 and started studying with Weiss as well as taking lessons from Cowell himself at The New School.
Cage's influence was also acknowledged by rock acts such as Sonic Youth (who performed some of the Number Pieces) and Stereolab (who named a song after Cage), composer and rock and jazz guitarist Frank Zappa, and various noise music artists and bands: indeed, one writer traced the origin of noise music to ''4′33″''.
The procedures varied from composition to composition, and were usually complex.
Since chance procedures were used by Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences.
Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, for the first time in two decades, had to start relying on commissions from other performers, and their respective abilities.
Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform.
I'm the first to be disturbed by it."
Hoping to find these, he left Chicago for New York City in the spring of 1942.
In the summer of 1954 he moved out of New York and settled in a cooperative community in Stony Point, New York, where his neighbors included David Tudor, M. C. Richards, Karen Karnes, Stan VanDerBeek, and Sari Dienes.
21, followed by a piece by Sergei Rachmaninoff.
Cage also attended, in late 1940s and early 1950s, D. T. Suzuki's lectures on Zen Buddhism, and read further the works of Coomaraswamy.
Cage started traveling, visited various places in France, Germany and Spain, as well as Capri and, most importantly, Majorca, where he started composing.
Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951.
Although Cage had used chance on a few earlier occasions, most notably in the third movement of ''Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra'' (1950–51), the ''I Ching'' opened new possibilities in this field for him.
Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others.
For example, works from ''Music for Piano'' were based on paper imperfections: the imperfections themselves provided pitches, coin tosses and ''I Ching'' hexagram numbers were used to determine the accidentals, clefs, and playing techniques.
Cage's ideas also found their way into sound design: for example, Academy Award-winning sound designer Gary Rydstrom cited Cage's work as a major influence.
In these works, Cage would borrow the rhythmic structure of the originals and fill it with pitches determined through chance procedures, or just replace some of the originals' pitches.
Cage's etudes are all extremely difficult to perform, a characteristic dictated by Cage's social and political views: the difficulty would ensure that "a performance would show that the impossible is not impossible"—this being Cage's answer to the notion that solving the world's political and social problems is impossible.
In an homage to Cage's dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 "performed an engrossing piece called 'Story/Time'.
The only film Cage produced was one of the Number Pieces, ''One11'', commissioned by composer and film director Henning Lohner who worked with Cage to produce and direct the 90-minute monochrome film.
After the orchestral ''Atlas Eclipticalis'' (1961–62), a work based on star charts, which was fully notated, Cage gradually shifted to, in his own words, "music (not composition)."
It was also at the Cornish School that Cage met a number of people who became lifelong friends, such as painter Mark Tobey and dancer Merce Cunningham.
In 1930 he dropped out, having come to believe that "college was of no use to a writer" after an incident described in the 1991 autobiographical statement:
Often crossing disciplines again, though, he encountered at Pomona the work of artist Marcel Duchamp via professor José Pijoan, of writer James Joyce via Don Sample, of philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy and of Cowell.
2'') consists of a single sentence: "In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action."
Among his works completed during the last years of the decade were ''Concert for Piano and Orchestra'' (1957–58), a seminal work in the history of graphic notation, and ''Variations I'' (1958).
Cage's "Experimental Composition" classes at The New School have become legendary as an American source of Fluxus, an international network of artists, composers, and designers.
During high school, one of his music teachers was Fannie Charles Dillon.
The result was a mass superimposition of many different musics on top of one another as determined by chance distribution, producing an event with a specifically theatric feel.
Tudor premiered most of Cage's works until the early 1960s, when he stopped performing on the piano and concentrated on electronic music.
Cage left Seattle in the summer of 1941 after the painter László Moholy-Nagy invited him to teach at the Chicago School of Design (what later became the IIT Institute of Design.
In 1952–53 he completed another mammoth project—the ''Williams Mix'', a piece of tape music, which Earle Brown helped to put together.
''Silence'' remained his most widely read and influential book.
The score of ''Variations III'' (1962) abounds in instructions to the performers, but makes no references to music, musical instruments or sounds.
Particularly well-known is the conversation mentioned in the 1958 lecture ''Indeterminacy'':
Finally, Thoreau's drawings informed the last works produced in 1978, ''Signals''.
Cage's method of using the ''I Ching'' was far from simple randomization.
A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde.
From 1956 to 1961 Cage taught classes in experimental composition at The New School, and from 1956 to 1958 he also worked as an art director and designer of typography.
The piece progresses from one ''gamut'' to another.
The ENO's Musicircus featured artists including Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and composer Michael Finnissy alongside ENO Music Director Edward Gardner, the ENO Community Choir, ENO Opera Works singers, and a collective of professional and amateur talents performing in the bars and front of house at London's Coliseum Opera House.
Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago.
The English National Opera became the first opera company to hold a Cage Musicircus on 3 March 2012 at the London Coliseum.
The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.
In 2012, amongst a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an 8-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more amongst the city's art museums and universities than performance spaces.
The latter work was written for David Tudor, whom Cage met through Feldman—another friendship that lasted until Cage's death.
He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband.
Much later, Cage recounted the incident: "...
His teachers included Henry Cowell (1933) and Arnold Schoenberg (1933–35), both known for their radical innovations in music, but Cage's major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures.
The ''I Ching'' is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance.
The piece was based on James Joyce's famous novel, ''Finnegans Wake'', which was one of Cage's favorite books, and one from which he derived texts for several more of his works.
This was accompanied by a busy touring schedule; consequently Cage's compositional output from that decade was scant.
# For this phrase for which this transposition of this mode will apply, which note am I using of the seven to imitate the note that Satie wrote?
The term "happenings" was coined by Allan Kaprow, one of his students, who defined it as a genre in the late fifties.
In ''Child of Tree'' (1975) and ''Branches'' (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus.
After I had been studying with him for two years, Schoenberg said, "In order to write music, you must have a feeling for harmony."
The last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.
For example, almost all composers of the English experimental school acknowledge his influence: Michael Parsons, Christopher Hobbs, John White, Gavin Bryars, who studied under Cage briefly, and Howard Skempton.
In 1967, Cage's ''A Year from Monday'' was first published by Wesleyan University Press.
Although Cage's affection for Satie's music was well-known, it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work, one in which the composer ''is'' present.
I have the feeling that sound is acting.
The composer's death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in Frankfurt by the composer Walter Zimmermann and the musicologist Stefan Schaedler was due to take place.
Many of the ''Variations'' and other 1960s pieces were in fact "happenings", an art form established by Cage and his students in late 1950s.
His reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the prepared piano—a piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on, beneath or between the strings—in 1940.
A chart system was also used (along with nested proportions) for the large piano work ''Music of Changes'' (1951), only here material would be selected from the charts by using the ''I Ching''.
