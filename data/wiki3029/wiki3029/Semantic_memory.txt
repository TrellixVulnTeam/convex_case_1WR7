The success of LSA and HAL gave birth to a whole field of statistical models of language.
Position emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) allow cognitive neuroscientists to explore different hypotheses concerning the neural network organization of semantic memory.
Temporal factors impact response consistency.
Semantic category specific impairments and modality specific impairments are apparent in disorders of semantic memory.
In LSA, a T × D matrix is constructed from a text corpus where T is the number of terms in the corpus and D is the number of documents (here "context" is interpreted as "document" and only words—or word phrases—are considered as items in memory).
in which he states that several factors differentiate episodic memory and  semantic memory differ in ways that include
Participants received three separate free construction of order tasks.
Perhaps the most popular of these models is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
This is not observed in semantic storage disorders.
Examples of different input modalities include visual, auditory and tactile input.
In WAS, "words that have similar associative structures are placed in similar regions of space."
The remembrance concept dealt with memories that contained experiences of an autobiographic index, whereas the memoria concept dealt with those memories that did not reference experiences having an autobiographic index.
- representation of living and nonliving things over feature and conceptual relationships or vice versa)
Different components represent information from different sensorimotor channels.
In the theory of grounded cognition, the meaning of a particular word is grounded in the sensorimotor systems.
In particular, ACT models memory as a set of related symbolic chunks which may be accessed by retrieval cues.
Numerous models of semantic memory have been proposed; they are summarized below.
Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point.
Research suggests that the temporal lobe might be responsible for category specific impairments of semantic memory disorders.
The ACT (Adaptive Control of Thought) (and later ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)) theory of cognition represents declarative memory (of which semantic memory is a part) with "chunks", which consist of a label, a set of defined relationships to other chunks (i.e., "this is a _", or "this has a _"), and any number of chunk-specific properties.
In his book titled "Episodic and Semantic Memory", Endel Tulving adopted the term "semantic" from linguists to refer to a system of memory for "words and verbal symbols, their meanings and referents, the relations between them, and the rules, formulas, or algorithms for influencing them."
vision) and even more specifically to a property within that modality (i.e.
Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.
It is suggested that within the temperoparietal network, the anterior temporal lobe is relatively more important for semantic processing, and posterior language regions are relatively more important for lexical retrieval.
Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal.
In that case, the time to answer the question "Is a chicken a bird?"
is a function of how far the activation between the nodes for "Chicken" and "Bird" must spread, i.e., the number of links between the nodes "Chicken" and "Bird".
The hippocampal areas are important to semantic memory's involvement with declarative memory.
Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex.
The LSA method states that similarity between words is reflected through their co-occurrence in a local context.
HAL computes an NxN matrix, where N is the number of words in its lexicon, using a 10-word reading frame that moves incrementally through a corpus of text.
The counterpart to declarative, or explicit memory, is procedural memory, or implicit memory.
Category specific impairments can be broken down into four categories.
Modality specific impairments are also divided into subsystems based on the type of information.
Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas.
Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times.
As in LSA (see above), the semantic similarity between two words is given by the cosine of the angle between their vectors (dimension reduction may be performed on this matrix, as well).
There are still a number of memory phenomena for which TLC has no account, including why people are able to respond quickly to obviously false questions (like "is a chicken a meteor?
This updated TLC is capable of explaining both the familiarity effect and the typicality effect.
After analyzing the data, the movies parallel the data from the books: when reconstructing the order of movies, "remember" serial position functions are essentially impartial from "know" serial functions.
Before Tulving's proposal, this area of human memory had been neglected by experimental psychologists.
Visual vs. verbal and perceptual vs. functional information are examples of information types.
Early work in perceptual and conceptual categorization assumed that categories had critical features and that category membership could be determined by logical rules for the combination of features.
A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is then performed on the matrix , which allows the number of dimensions in the matrix to be reduced, thus clustering LSA's semantic representations and providing for indirect association between items.
The presence of a set of items and/or a context is more likely to evoke, then, some subset of the items in memory.
When recreating the order of the 7 books, "remember" serial position functions were indistinguishable from "know" serial position functions.
The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all.
Many of these models bear similarity to the algorithms used in search engines (for example, see Griffiths, ''et al.
Furthermore, properties are stored at the highest category level to which they apply.
For example, when one thinks of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through sensorimotor simulation.
That is, when a node becomes active, that activation spreads to other nodes via the links between them.
Thus, a complete theory of semantic memory must account not only for the representational structure of such "gists", but also for how they can be extracted from experience.
The semantic feature-comparison model, proposed by Smith, Shoben, and Rips (1974), describes memory as being composed of feature lists for different concepts.
Processing in a semantic network often takes the form of spreading activation (see above).
For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat.
Participants received a list of 7 book titles and 18 film titles.
Modality specificity can account for category specific impairments in semantic memory disorders.
Response consistency is the next factor.
*2: I have heard of this book/film, but have no other knowledge of it
Semantic networks see the most use in models of discourse and logical comprehension, as well as in Artificial Intelligence.
A more up-to-date list of such models may be found under the topic Measures of semantic relatedness.
Semantic memory disorders fall into two groups.
'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences.
This concludes that contract to Tulving's (1985b) original hypothesis, "remember-know" discernments do not accurately reflect the memory supporting performance.
Learning of associations is generally believed to be a Hebbian process; that is, whenever two items in memory are simultaneously active, the association between them grows stronger, and the more likely either item is to activate the other.
Alzheimer's disease is a semantic memory disorder that results in errors describing and naming objects, though not necessarily category-specific.
This provides an economy of representation in that properties are only stored at the category level at which they become essential, that is, at which point they become critical features (see below).
The use of semantic memory is quite different from that of episodic memory.
A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction.
This latency is used in measuring the response time of the ACT model, to compare it to human performance.
The degree of semantic relatedness of items in memory is given by the cosine of the angle between the items' context vectors (ranging from 1 for perfect synonyms to 0 for no relationship).
The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests semantic relatedness.
On the one hand, many researchers and clinicians believe that semantic memory is stored by the same brain systems involved in episodic memory.
Semantic dementia is another disorder associated with semantic memory.
Depending on the damage to the semantic system, one type might be favored over the other.
While ACT is a model of cognition in general, and not memory in particular, it nonetheless posits certain features of the structure of memory, as described above.
While the model of memory employed in ACT is similar in some ways to a semantic network, the processing involved is more akin to an associative model.
Other disorders that affect semantic memory - such as Alzheimer's disease - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects.
For example, it has been speculated that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.
The "association"—a relationship between two pieces of information—is a fundamental concept in psychology, and associations at various levels of mental representation are essential to models of memory and cognition in general.
Its biggest advantage is that it clearly explains priming: you are more likely to retrieve information from memory if related information (the "prime") has been presented a short time before.
*4:I have read/seen this book/film once
According to Madigan in his book titled Memory, semantic memory is the sum of all knowledge one has obtained—whether it be vocabulary, understanding of math, or all the facts one knows.
The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by the fact that episodic and semantic memory appear to function in different yet mutually dependent ways.
The essence of semantic memory is that its contents are not tied to any particular instance of experience, as in episodic memory.
Nodes may also store negations of the properties of their superordinate nodes (i.e., "NOT-can fly" would be stored with "penguin").
"), when the relevant nodes are very far apart in the network.
The two measures used to measure semantic relatedness in this model are the Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and the Word association spaces (WAS).
The hippocampal formation includes, among other structures: the hippocampus itself, the entorhinal cortex, and the perirhinal cortex.
In this model, each node is a word, representing a concept (like "Bird").
During the experiment, semantic associations remain fixed showing the assumption that semantic associations are not significantly impacted by the episodic experience of one experiment.
Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition.
Since Tulvings inception of these distinctions, several experimenters have conducted tests to determine the validity of his hypothesized differences between episodic and semantic memory.
Understanding these types of impairments will give insight into how disorders of semantic memory function.
There is, additionally, a retrieval latency, which varies inversely with the amount by which the activation of the retrieved chunk exceeds the retrieval threshold.
Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives.
The STS has limited capacity and affects the retrieval process by limiting the amount of information that can be sampled and limiting the time the sampled subset is in an active mode.
# the characteristics of their operations,
Each cell in the matrix is then transformed according to the equation:
Additionally, deficits in semantic memory as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments.
For example, subjects might verify a sentence by comparing the feature sets that represent its subject and predicate concepts.
Perceptual and functional features, topographic organization, informativeness and intercorrelations are areas of decreased functioning in disorders of semantic memory (Warrington and Shallice, 1984).
The original version of TLC did not put weights on the links between nodes.
Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect.
In SAM, when any two items simultaneously occupy a working memory buffer, the strength of their association is incremented.
He (Who was influenced?)
Though SAM was originally designed to model episodic memory, its mechanisms are sufficient to support some semantic memory representations, as well.
Though these models differ in specifics, they generally employ an (Item × Context) matrix where each cell represents the number of times an item in memory has occurred in a given context.
Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states.
The left inferior prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left posterior temporal areas are other areas involved in semantic memory use.
TLC is an instance of a more general class of models known as semantic networks.
Indeed, neural networks and semantic networks may be characterized as associative models of cognition.
Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way as a result of the activation of different mental processes during retrieval.
Feature models view semantic categories as being composed of relatively unstructured sets of features.
The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as amodal perceptions.
Neuroimaging evidence suggests that left hippocampal areas show an increase in activity during semantic memory tasks.
In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times.
Collins and Quillian later updated TLC to include weighted connections to account for this effect.
Semantic memory refers to general facts and meanings one shares with others whereas episodic memory refers to unique and concrete personal experiences.
The SAM model contains a short- term store (STS) and long term store (LTS), where STS is a briefly activated subset of the information in the LTS.
They were asked to reconstruct the original order of release for the books/films.
With each node is stored a set of properties (like "can fly" or "has wings") as well as pointers (i.e., links) to other nodes (like "Chicken").
Tulving constructed a proposal to distinguish between episodic memory and what he termed semantic memory.
Recent evidence supports the idea that the temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation.
verbal) conceptual knowledge, perhaps in some categorically-organized fashion."
Processing in TLC is a form of spreading activation.
A variety of studies have been done in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of semantic memory.
Non-related words would fall into this group.
'', 2007 and Anderson, 1990), though it is not yet clear whether they really use the same computational mechanisms.
A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions.
Thompson-Schill (2003) found that the left or bilateral ventral temporal cortex appears to be involved in retrieval of knowledge of color and form, the left lateral temporal cortex in knowledge of motion, and the parietal cortex in knowledge of size.
*5: I have read/seen this book/film multiple times
Category-specific impairments might indicate that knowledge may rely differentially upon sensory and motor properties encoded in separate areas (Farah and McClelland, 1991).
# the kind of information they process, and
There was one exception of a significant difference in familiarity ratings when considering just the second position from the end and the final position.
A new idea that is still at the early stages of development is that semantic memory, like perception, can be subdivided into types of visual information—color, size, form, and motion.
Impairments include difficulty in generating familiar words, difficulty naming objects and difficulties with visual recognition.
The set of associations among a collection of items in memory is equivalent to the links between nodes in a network, where each node corresponds to a unique item in memory.
We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past.
These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.
These networks include "extensive regions of ventral (form and color knowledge) and lateral (motion knowledge) temporal cortex, parietal cortex (size knowledge), and premotor cortex (manipulation knowledge).
Semantic memory is also discussed in reference to modality.
For example, "is yellow" would be stored with "Canary", "has wings" would be stored with "Bird" (one level up), and "can move" would be stored with "Animal" (another level up).
Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge (Koenig et al.
In this system, the hippocampal formation "encodes" memories, or makes it possible for memories to form at all, and the cortex stores memories after the initial encoding process is completed.
However, associations are often more clearly represented as an ''N''×''N'' matrix, where ''N'' is the number of items in memory.
This version performed comparably to humans in many tasks, but failed to predict that people would respond faster to questions regarding more typical category instances than those involving less typical instances.
# their application to the real world as well as the memory laboratory.
Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and semantic relatedness are the four factors used to differentiate between semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders.
The probability of being sampled is dependent on the strength of association between the cue and the item being retrieved, with stronger associations being sampled and finally one is chosen.
In many cases, there is a point where one domain is better than the other (i.e.
For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping.
Rather than any one brain region playing a dedicated and privileged role in the representation or retrieval of all sorts of semantic knowledge, semantic memory is a collection of functionally and anatomically distinct systems, where each attribute-specific system is tied to a sensorimotor modality (i.e.
In addition to category specific impairments, modality specific impairments are included in disorders of semantic memory (Cohen et al.
For example, "cat" and "dog" may never appear together in the same context, so their close semantic relationship may not be well-captured by LSA's original matrix .
Temporal lobe damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to semantic impairments.
For an example of a computational implementation of semantic networks in knowledge representation, see Cravo and Martins (1993).
'''Semantic memory''' is one of the two types of declarative or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved).
was mainly influenced by the ideas of Reiff and Scheers, who in 1959 made the distinction between two primary forms of memory.
Chunks, then, can be mapped as a semantic network, given that each node is a chunk with its unique properties, and each link is the chunk's relationship to another chunk.
In SAM, then, memories consist of a set of associations between items in memory and between items and contexts.
Generally speaking, a network is composed of a set of nodes connected by links.
Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as may be found in a neural network.
Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that your knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex.
A standard model of memory that employs association in this manner is the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model.
Such research has challenged previously utilized amodal views.
The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model considers context only as the words that immediately surround a given word.
More recent theories have accepted that categories may have an ill-defined or "fuzzy" structure and have proposed probabilistic or global similarity models for the verification of category membership.
The retrieval process in LTS is cue dependent and probabilistic, meaning that a cue initiates the retrieval process and the selected information from memory is random.
Semantic memory disorders fractionate into two categories.
In ACT, a chunk's activation decreases as a function of the time since the chunk was created and increases with the number of times the chunk has been retrieved from memory.
See below for specific operationalizations of associative models.
Essentially, then, two words are closely semantically related if they appear in similar types of documents.
They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment.
Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to four factors.
The degree to which items evoke one another—either by virtue of their shared context or their co-occurrence—is an indication of the items' semantic relatedness.
Chunks can also receive activation from Gaussian noise, and from their similarity to other chunks.
This strongly suggests that encoding of information leading to semantic memory does not have its physiological basis in the hippocampus.
However, by performing the SVD and reducing the number of dimensions in the matrix, the context vectors of "cat" and "dog"—which would be very similar—would migrate toward one another and perhaps merge, thus allowing "cat" and "dog" to act as retrieval cues for each other, even though they may never have co-occurred.
Note that this may hold true even when the words being compared never actually co-occur (i.e., "chicken" and "canary").
Various neural imaging and research points to semantic memory and episodic memory resulting from distinct areas in the brain.
Different diseases and disorders can affect the biological workings of semantic memory.
Amnesics with damage to the hippocampus but some spared parahippocampal cortex were able to demonstrate some degree of intact semantic memory despite a total loss of episodic memory.
The links may be weighted such that some are stronger than others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others.
One of the first examples of a network model of semantic memory is the Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC).
When retrieving items from memory, ACT looks at the most active chunk in memory; if it is above threshold, it is retrieved, otherwise an "error of omission" has occurred, i.e., the item has been forgotten.
Neuroimaging studies also suggest a distinction between semantic processing and sensorimotor processing.
It holds generic information that is more than likely acquired across various contexts and is used across different situations.
Items in SAM are also associated with a specific context, where the strength of that association determined by how long each item is present in a given context.
This experiment demonstrated if serial position functions perceived when the participants reconstructed the order of books or movies differed as a function of whether they "remember" the item in question or just "know" that the particular item occurred in a distinct order.
According to this view, the relations between categories would not be directly retrieved, they would be indirectly computed.
Each session lasted approximately 15 minutes.
One form was entitled "remembrances", the other "memoria".
One hundred eighty undergraduate students from Lake Forrest College completed the study in groups of approximately 40 students in a classroom setting.
Tulving discusses conceptions of episodic and semantic memory in his book titled Elements of Episodic Memory.
The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes.
Category-specific impairments can involve cortical regions where living and nonliving things are represented and where feature and conceptual relationships are represented.
Modality specific impairments are divided into separate subsystems on the basis of input modality.
In these models, the nodes correspond to words or word stems and the links represent syntactic relations between them.
Like in SAM (see above), any time two words are simultaneously in the frame, the association between them is increased, that is, the corresponding cell in the NxN matrix is incremented.
