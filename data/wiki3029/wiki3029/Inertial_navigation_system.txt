This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel the car turn left and right or tilt up and down as the car ascends or descends hills.
The electrodes that drive and sense the standing waves are deposited directly onto separate quartz structures that surround the resonator.
However, their cost and complexity place constraints on the environments in which they are practical for use.
Relatively simple electronic circuits can be used to add up the linear accelerations, because the directions of the linear accelerometers do not change.
The system is both manufacturable and inexpensive.
Recent advances in the construction of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have made it possible to manufacture small and light inertial navigation systems.
Therefore, the position must be periodically corrected by input from some other type of navigation system.
A key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product (v, xdv, /dt) to be used as the basic autopilot rate signalsâ€”a technique that became known as ''cross-product steering''.
By using the original orientation of the system in the inertial reference frame as the initial condition and integrating the angular velocity, the system's current orientation is known at all times.
A ring laser gyro splits a beam of laser light into two beams in opposite directions through narrow tunnels in a closed optical circular path around the perimeter of a triangular block of temperature-stable Cervit glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner.
Accelerometers measure the linear acceleration of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame, but in directions that can only be measured relative to the moving system (since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system, but are not aware of their own orientation).
The advantage of an INS is that it requires no external references in order to determine its position, orientation, or velocity once it has been initialized.
After SRB separation the primary space shuttle guidance is named PEG (Powered Explicit Guidance).
As Astronauts are the customer for the system, many new teams were formed that touch GN&C as it is a primary interface to "fly" the vehicle.
An INS can detect a change in its geographic position (a move east or north, for example), a change in its velocity (speed and direction of movement), and a change in its orientation (rotation about an axis).
Less-expensive navigation systems, intended for use in automobiles, may use a vibrating structure gyroscope to detect changes in heading, and the odometer pickup to measure distance covered along the vehicle's track.
Gimbal lock constrains maneuvering, and it would be beneficial to eliminate the slip rings and bearings of the gimbals.
Solid state devices using the same physical principles are used for image stabilization in small cameras or camcorders.
Angular rate sensors called ''rate gyros'' measure the angular velocity of the vehicle.

One example of a popular INS for commercial aircraft was the Delco Carousel, which provided partial automation of navigation in the days before complete flight management systems became commonplace.
These devices have no moving parts, and weigh about .
There are two gyroscopes (usually) on the platform.
Such gyros operate in accordance with the dynamic theory that when an angle rate is applied to a translating body, a Coriolis force is generated.
Like all gyrostabilized platforms, this system runs well with relatively slow, low-power computers.
Several coil strips are mounted on great circles around the spherical shell of the gyrostabilized platform.
The basic, open-loop accelerometer consists of a mass attached to a spring.
The KC-135 fleet was fitted with a dual Carousel system that was aided by a Doppler radar.
Also, super/subscripts of E, I and B are representing variables in the Earth centered, Inertial or Body reference frame, respectively and C is a transformation of reference frames.
The navigation error rises with the lower sensitivity of the sensors used.
The fluid bearings are very slippery, and the spherical platform can turn freely.
For example, if, in terrestrial use, the inertially tracked velocity is intermittently updated to zero by stopping, the position will remain precise for a much longer time, a so-called ''zero velocity update''.
Some small missiles have powered the platform with light from a window or optic fibers to the motor.
as a vehicle moves from place to place.
Then it integrates the velocity to calculate the current position.
This process has been FAA certified to recover pure INS performance equivalent to stationary align procedures for civilian flight times up to 18 hours.
The gimbals are a set of three rings, each with a pair of bearings initially at right angles.
The FOG requires more complex calibrations than a Laser ring gyro making the development and manufacture of FOG's more technically challenging that for a RLG.
That is, it must integrate the vehicle's attitude changes in pitch, roll and yaw, as well as gross movements.
A research topic is to suspend the platform with pressure from exhaust gases.
There are usually four bearing pads, mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform.
The initial Delta guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory.
By mounting a pair of gyroscopes (of the same rotational inertia and spinning at the same speed in opposite directions) at right angles the precessions are cancelled, and the platform will resist twisting.
of General Motors to design and build the first production Carousel systems for the early models (-100, -200, and -300) models of the 747 aircraft.
In aerospace particularly, other measurement systems are used to determine INS inaccuracies, e.g.
Since the new position is calculated from the previous calculated position and the measured acceleration and angular velocity, these errors accumulate roughly proportionally to the time since the initial position was input.
For the space shuttle, an open loop (no feedback) guidance was used to guide the shuttle from lift off until Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation.

If navigation systems malfunction, they can send planes off course.
Aluminum electrodes evaporated onto the forks and the underlying chip both drive and sense the motion.
Some systems place the linear accelerometers on a gimbaled gyrostabilized platform.
Based on this information alone, they know how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself, that is, whether it is accelerating forward, backward, left, right, up (toward the car's ceiling), or down (toward the car's floor) measured relative to the car, but not the direction relative to the Earth, since they did not know what direction the car was facing relative to the Earth when they felt the accelerations.
An inertial guidance system that will operate near the surface
Two gyroscopes are used to cancel gyroscopic precession, the tendency of a gyroscope to twist at right angles  to an input torque.
Inertial navigation systems are used in many different moving objects, including vehicles&mdash;such as aircraft, submarines, spacecraft&mdash;and guided missiles.
To unlock the counter-rotating light beams, laser gyros either have independent light paths for the two directions (usually in fiber optic gyros), or the laser gyro is mounted on a piezo-electric dither motor that rapidly vibrates the laser ring back and forth about its input axis through the lock-in region to decouple the light waves.
It also has moving parts that can wear out or jam, and is vulnerable to gimbal lock.
The big disadvantage of this scheme is that it uses many expensive precision mechanical parts.
A computer continually calculates the vehicle's current position.
The 747 utilized three Carousel systems operating in concert for reliability purposes.
Since it requires no external reference (after initialization), it is immune to jamming and deception.
Accordingly, inertial navigation is usually used to supplement other navigation systems, providing a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with the use of any single system.
The higher rate is needed to let the navigation system integrate the angular rate into an attitude accurately.
This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel themselves pressed back into their seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down; and feel themselves pressed down into their seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as the car passes over the crest of a hill and begins to descend.
The shaker is the most accurate, because both light beams use exactly the same path.
The inaccuracy of a good-quality navigational system is normally less than 0.6 nautical miles per hour in position and on the order of tenths of a degree per hour in orientation.
The Q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector.
These advances have widened the range of possible applications to include areas such as human and animal motion capture.
Lightweight digital computers permit the system to eliminate the gimbals, creating ''strapdown'' systems, so called because their sensors are simply strapped to the vehicle.
The fluid bearings are pads with holes through which pressurized inert gas (such as Helium) or oil press against the spherical shell of the platform.
This system has almost no moving parts, and is very accurate.
Boeing Corporation subcontracted the Delco Electronics Div.
However FOG's do not suffer from laser lock at low speeds and do not need to contain any moving parts, increasing the maximum potential accuracy and lifespan of a FOG over an equivalent RLG.
By properly combining the information from an INS and other systems (GPS/INS), the errors in position and velocity are stable.
Currently, devices combining different sensors are being developed, e.g.
Performing integration on the inertial accelerations (using the original velocity as the initial conditions) using the correct kinematic equations yields the inertial velocities of the system, and integration again (using the original position as the initial condition) yields the inertial position.
The data updating algorithms (''direction cosines'' or quaternions) involved are too complex to be accurately performed except by digital electronics.
Precise winding of the fiber-optic coil is required to ensure the paths taken by the light in opposite directions is as similar as possible.
The system resonators are machined from quartz due to its excellent mechanical properties.
An '''inertial navigation system''' ('''INS''') is a navigation aid that uses a computer, motion sensors (accelerometers) and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate via dead reckoning the position, orientation, and velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references.
The movement of the outer case with respect to the standing wave pattern is proportional to the total rotation angle and can be sensed by appropriate electronics.
In premium systems, the angular sensors are usually specialized transformer coils made in a strip on a flexible printed circuit board.
These systems can have very high precisions (e.g., Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere).
Inertial guidance systems are now usually combined with satellite navigation systems through a digital filtering system.
GPS in the OI-22 build), the guidance core of the Shuttle GN&C system had evolved little.
Estimation theory in general, and Kalman filtering in particular, provide a theoretical framework for combining information from various sensors.
Gyroscopes measure the angular velocity of the sensor frame with respect to the inertial reference frame.
The acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance, mass, and the spring constant.
When the gyro is rotating at some angular rate, the distance traveled by each beam becomes differentâ€”the shorter path being opposite to the rotation.
The mass is constrained to move only in-line with the spring.
Gimballed systems could usually do well with update rates of 50â€“60&nbsp;Hz.
Furthermore, INS can be used as a short-term fallback while GPS signals are unavailable, for example when a vehicle passes through a tunnel.
These can be extremely small, around , and are built with Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies.
Acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied.
Older INS systems generally used an inertial platform as their mounting point to the vehicle, and the terms are sometimes considered synonymous.
and are starting to become more widespread in applications where superb accuracy is required (like submarine navigation or strategic ICBM guidance) and FOG based strapdown inertial navigation systems have been selected by the UK Royal Navy for the Astute class submarine and the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers.
Thus laser gyros retain moving parts, but they do not move as far.
The Atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an on-board autonomous system, and a ground-based tracking and command system.
This is accomplished using GPS and an inertial reasonableness test, thereby allowing commercial data integrity requirements to be met.
In addition, this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth past the natural frequency of the sensing element.
As the forks are twisted about the axis of the handle, the vibration of the tines tends to continue in the same plane of motion.

The Q system's revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance (and associated equations of motion) in the matrix Q.
The result is that there is no change in the interference pattern, and therefore no measurement change.
Based on this information alone, the passenger knows what direction the car is facing but not how fast or slow it is moving, or whether it is sliding sideways.
Inertial navigation is used in a wide range of applications including the navigation of aircraft, tactical and strategic missiles, spacecraft, submarines and ships.
Delco produced the IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) for these systems, Kollsman Instrument Corp. produced the Optical Systems,  and the  Apollo Guidance Computer was built by Raytheon under subcontract.
Whenever the mass deflects, the feedback loop causes an electric coil to apply an equally negative force on the mass, canceling the motion.
The INS is initially provided with its position and velocity from another source (a human operator, a GPS satellite receiver, etc.)
Early German World War II V2 guidance systems combined two gyroscopes and a lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight.

This system is usually integrated on a silicon chip.
These IMUs have demonstrated extremely high reliability since their initial use in 1996.
All inertial navigation systems suffer from '''integration drift''': small errors in the measurement of acceleration and angular velocity are integrated into progressively larger errors in velocity, which are compounded into still greater errors in position.
Therefore, some systems use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber to mount a gyrostabilized platform.
These products include 'tuning fork gyros'.
Because the mass barely moves, the non-linearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced.
Although many updates to the shuttle's navigation system had taken place over the last 30 years (ex.
American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard experimented with rudimentary gyroscopic systems.
Inertial measurement units (IMUs) typically contain three orthogonal rate-gyroscopes and three orthogonal accelerometers, measuring angular velocity and linear acceleration respectively.
The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of spacecraft, guided missiles, and commercial airliners.
This type of system is much less accurate than a higher-end INS, but it is adequate for the typical automobile application where GPS is the primary navigation system, and dead reckoning is only needed to fill gaps in GPS coverage when buildings or terrain block the satellite signals.
This system allows a vehicle's roll, pitch, and yaw angles to be measured directly at the bearings of the gimbals.
This reduces the cost, eliminates gimbal lock, removes the need for some calibrations, and increases the reliability by eliminating some of the moving parts.
Analog computer signals were used to drive four graphite rudders in the rocket exhaust for flight control.

So these TIMU chips for Micro-PNT have integrated 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and 3-axis magnetometer, and together with the integrated highly accurate master timing clock it simultaneous measure the motion tracked and combines that with timing from the synchronized clock, and with sensor fusion it makes a single chip that does absolute position tracking, all without external transmitters/transceivers.
Inertial navigation is a self-contained navigation technique in which measurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the position and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point, orientation and velocity.
PEG takes into account both the Q system and the predictor-corrector attributes of the original "Delta" System (PEG Guidance).
In space exploration, a mixture of the two remains.

These gyros can operate in either a whole angle mode (which gives them nearly unlimited rate capability) or a force rebalance mode that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro housing (which gives them much better accuracy).
The challenges faced by the Delta efforts were overcome by the Q system (see Q-guidance) of guidance.
They arrived at Fort Bliss, Texas in 1945 under the provisions of Operation Paperclip and were subsequently moved to Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950  where they worked for U.S. Army rocket research programs.
Here, the gyro is designed as an electronically driven tuning fork, often fabricated out of a single piece of quartz or silicon.
First, for each of the six degrees of freedom (x,y,z and Î¸x, Î¸y and Î¸z), it integrates over time the sensed  acceleration, together with an estimate of gravity, to calculate the current velocity.
This is known as a ''lock-in'', or ''laser-lock''.
However, digital computers are now so inexpensive and fast that rate gyro systems can now be practically used and mass-produced.
The Carousel system and derivatives thereof were subsequently adopted for use in many other commercial and military aircraft.
A closed-loop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection, thus keeping the mass nearly stationary.
In practice, at low rotation rates the output frequency can drop to zero after the result of backscattering causing the beams to synchronise and lock together.

They let the platform twist about any rotational axis (or, rather, they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it).
Indoor applications can use pedometers, distance measurement equipment, or other kinds of Position sensors.
Maneuvers had to be carefully planned to avoid gimbal lock.
The phase-shift between the two beams can be measured by an interferometer, and is proportional to the rate of rotation (Sagnac effect).
