Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess.
In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of group decision making, praise and criticism (feedback), and the management of the group tasks (project management) according to three styles: authoritarian, democratic, and laissez-faire.
Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson, in ''Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'', present evidence that only humans and chimpanzees, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, territoriality, and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.
The path-goal model can be classified both as a contingency theory, as it depends on the circumstances, and as a transactional leadership theory, as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.
They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented.
In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).
The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).
Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.
Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.
Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it.
According to some, leadership is determined by distinctive dispositional characteristics present at birth (e.g., extraversion; intelligence; ingenuity).
The path-goal theory of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the expectancy theory of Victor Vroom.
# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and task strategy.
In most cases these teams are tasked to operate in remote and changeable environments with limited support or backup (action environments).
While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.
Over the years the philosophical terminology of "management" and "leadership" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings.
Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.
The use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates.
''Terms fallacies in their thinking are:''
Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods.
* Do not consider how stable leader attributes account for the behavioral diversity necessary for effective leadership.
When one has all five virtues together, each appropriate to its function, then one can be a leader.
Scouller therefore proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an "Integrated Psychological" theory on the Businessballs education website.
Most theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made.
Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.
This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.
B.F. Skinner is the father of behavior modification and developed the concept of positive reinforcement.
A number of works in the 19th century – when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane – explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of Thomas Carlyle and of Francis Galton, whose works have prompted decades of research.
This "need for a leader" becomes especially strong in troubled groups that are experiencing some sort of conflict.
Excessive discipline and sternness in command result in cruelty.
In research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the leader improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.
Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between "transactional" leadership (characterized by e.g.
These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment.
Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure.
However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature.
For example, group cohesion, communication patterns among members, individual personality traits, group context, the nature or orientation of the work, as well as behavioral norms and established standards influence group functionality in varying capacities.
In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure.
In this situation, more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole.
Exercise of humaneness alone results in weakness.
Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership performance, including outcomes such as leader effectiveness, leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008).
For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good.
While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, & Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001).
The doctrines of Caesaro-papism have recurred and had their detractors over several centuries.
For a more general take on leadership in politics, compare the concept of the statesperson.
These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.
Every organization needs leaders at every level.
It is well known that the naval hero Lord Nelson often wrote his own versions of battles he was involved in, so that when he arrived home in England he would receive a true hero's welcome.
The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.
To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.
In Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates.
The democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality.
This position is contentious.
* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.
Specifically, Zaccaro (2007) noted that trait theories still:
LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''.
Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader.
Examples – feedback giving, allocating tasks, resource distribution.
These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation.
Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future.
What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.
In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as consideration and initiating structure.
Another factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female.
Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual.
Despite popular belief, the use of manipulation, coercion, and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership.
These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called "the four dimensions of leadership".
In the 19th century the elaboration of anarchist thought called the whole concept of leadership into question.
In prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival.
The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the "hearts and minds" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not "take charge", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.
(Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern & Lubar.)
(1996), Zaccaro et al.
* Focus on a small set of individual attributes such as Big Five personality traits, to the neglect of cognitive abilities, motives, values, social skills, expertise, and problem-solving skills.
However, managers need to be aware of unsuccessful executives who once showed management potential but who are later dismissed or retired early.
In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations.
However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.
Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.
The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life — the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.
An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position.
The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time.
Out-group members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts.
Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management.
In contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership.
The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective.
David McClelland, for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego.
Victor Vroom, in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973) and later with Arthur Jago (1988), developed a taxonomy for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative decision model where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.
Although research has indicated that group members' dependence on group leaders can lead to reduced self-reliance and overall group strength, most people actually prefer to be led than to be without a leader (Berkowitz, 1953).
The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response.
Good leaders use their own inner mentors to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.
In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al.
According to House, the essence of the theory is "the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance".
Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.
It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.
For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.
It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of servant leadership and authentic leadership.
Although leadership is certainly a form of power, it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people – rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).
It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else.
Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done.
In response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.
Dependence on the strength of courage results in violence.
A toxic leader is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader–follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when he/she joined it.
In the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1987).
This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "trait theory of leadership".
Situational theory also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership.
Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent.
In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes..
Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation.
The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting.
* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.
The situational leadership model proposed by Hersey and Blanchard suggests four leadership-styles and four levels of follower-development.
Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader (Stewart & Manz, 1995).
In the autocratic/paternalistic strain of thought, traditionalists recall the role of leadership of the Roman ''pater familias''.
However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions.
Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships.
traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, largely by introducing a new element – the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery.
* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.
Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).
Job performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990).
Another theory that addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory, which evolved from an earlier theory called the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) model.
Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and discipline ... Reliance on intelligence alone results in rebelliousness.
In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.
Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance.
According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example that embodies integrity, assertiveness, and social abilities in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.
Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization.
This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.
In other words, the reproduction of information or stories form the basis of the perception of leadership by the majority.
In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders.
Others may see the traditional leadership of a boss as costing too much in team performance.
They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done.
They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members.
The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times.
One of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from Werner Erhard, Michael C. Jensen, Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as “an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn’t going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...”.
This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.
In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.
In modern society, the press, blogs and other sources report their own views of leaders, which may be based on reality, but may also be based on a political command, a payment, or an inherent interest of the author, media, or leader.
Herbert Spencer (1884) (and Karl Marx) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.
Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.
However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.
The Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e.
* Individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.
Leadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations.
In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.
When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others.
Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men.
* There must be interpersonal relationship.
Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers.
Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day & Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008).
The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager.
If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences.
Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization.
charisma, and intelligence, among others.
Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others.
* Significant relationships exist between leadership emergence and such individual traits as:
One response to this denial of élitism came with Leninism, which demanded an élite group of disciplined cadres to act as the vanguard of a socialist revolution, bringing into existence the dictatorship of the proletariat.
It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader.
However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances.
Self-leadership is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act.
* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.
Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.
* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.
This has been termed action oriented leadership.
* ''Invulnerability fallacy'': Believing they can get away with doing what they want because they are too clever to get caught; even if they are caught, believing they will go unpunished because of their importance.
In contrast to the Fiedler contingency model, the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands.
To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of mindfulness meditation.
They typically fail because of personality factors rather than job performances.
After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited.
# The mood of individual group members.
The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual membership.
Considering the criticisms of the trait theory outlined above, several researchers have begun to adopt a different perspective of leader individual differences—the leader attribute pattern approach.
Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.
(Note that the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the word "leadership" in English only as far back as the 19th century.)
The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests.
* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.
Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct.
Group affective tone represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group.
The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches.
A variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions.
In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power.
Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand.
Moreover, it has been documented that group performance, creativity, and efficiency all tend to climb in businesses with designated managers or CEOs.
The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.
This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists.
Therefore, one can argue that the perception of all leaders is created and in fact does not reflect their true leadership qualities at all.
According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader.
It is an expression of who we are as people.
A leadership style is a leader's style of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people.
In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.
Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow.
'''Characteristics of a Team'''
emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and "transformational" leadership (characterized by e.g.
It is not dependent on title or formal authority.
Comparable to the Roman tradition, the views of Confucianism on "right living" relate very much to the ideal of the (male) scholar-leader and his benevolent rule, buttressed by a tradition of filial piety.
* ''Egocentrism fallacy'': Believing they are the only ones who matter, that the people who work for them don't count
These Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:
* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits.
Group members with leaders in a positive mood experience more positive mood than do group members with leaders in a negative mood.
For effectiveness, the model posits that the leadership-style must match the appropriate level of follower-development.
Philosophical writings from Plato's ''Republic'' to Plutarch's ''Lives'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?"
If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another.
As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented.
Beyond the leader's mood, her/his behavior is a source for employee positive and negative emotions at work.
Functional leadership theory (Hackman & Walton, 1986; McGrath, 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness.
