In eastern Arabia, inscriptions in a script derived from ASA attest to a language known as Hasaitic.
Some traditionally Christian villages in rural areas of the Levant render the sound as , as do Shiʻi Bahrainis.
The medieval Arabs actually termed their language '''' 'the language of the Ḍād' (the name of the letter used for this sound), since they thought the sound was unique to their language.
Arabic is a Central Semitic language, closely related to the Northwest Semitic languages (Aramaic, Hebrew, Ugaritic and Phoenician), the Ancient South Arabian languages, and various other Semitic languages of Arabia such as Dadanitic.
The same can be said, some centuries later, about the Andalusian ''zajal''.

'I read', '''' 'I ate', '''' 'I went', although other patterns are possible (e.g. ''''
Arabic has consonants traditionally termed "emphatic"  (), which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization  as well as varying degrees of velarization , so they may be written with the "Velarized or pharyngealized" diacritic () as: .
However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular.
In Najd and parts of western Arabia, a language known to scholars as Thamudic C is attested.
Pronouns in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender.
* '''' 'I corresponded (with someone)'"

If considered separate languages, the most-spoken variety would most likely be Egyptian Arabic with 89 million native speakers—still greater than any other Afroasiatic language.
), which become  and , respectively.
The past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective, indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect.

Universities around the world have classes that teach Arabic as part of their foreign languages, Middle Eastern studies, and religious studies courses.
For instance, using capitalization, the letter , may be represented by '''d'''.
''Arabic'' usually designates one of three main variants: Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and ''colloquial'' or ''dialectal'' Arabic.
* If the word occurs at the beginning of an utterance, a glottal stop  is added onto the beginning, e.g.,  '''' 'The house is&nbsp;...' .
Many dialects (such as Egyptian, Levantine, and much of the Maghreb) subsequently lost  fricatives, converting  into .
The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal.
Arabic belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family.
* ''Full endings'' (including case endings) occur when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added (e.g., '''' 'us/our').
In addition, MSA has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in Quranic times, and MSA continues to evolve.
* Given this restriction, the last heavy syllable (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed, if it is not the final syllable.
But it is rendered as a voiced velar plosive  in Persian Gulf, Upper Egypt, parts of the Maghreb, and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g.
whether to interpret ''sh'' as a single sound, as in ''gash'', or a combination of two sounds, as in ''gashouse''.
Some dialects have different stress rules.
As mentioned above, many spoken dialects have a process of ''emphasis spreading'', where the "emphasis" (pharyngealization) of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables, pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone  in all nearby low vowels.
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above.
This simultaneous articulation is described as "Retracted Tongue Root" by phonologists.
Some of the most influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Hindi, Malay, Maldivian, Indonesian, Pashto, Punjabi, Tagalog, Sindhi and Hausa and some languages in parts of Africa.
The extent of emphasis spreading varies.
The following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic:
Yemeni Arabic (Sanaa)
# vestiges of ''nunation''
In most of present-day North Africa, the Western Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are used.
However, in Egypt and Arabic-speaking countries to the east of it, the Eastern Arabic numerals ( –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – ) are in use.
When representing a number in Arabic, the lowest-valued position is placed on the right, so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts.
* The past tense singular endings written formally as ''-tu -ta -ti'' are pronounced ''-t -t -ti''.
Aramaic also held prestige as a written language in parts of northern and eastern Arabia in antiquity.
It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media.
The most active are in Damascus and Cairo.
Modern Standard Arabic
(They differ in that, for example, the same letter  is used to represent both a consonant, as in "'''y'''ou" or "'''y'''et", and a vowel, as in "m'''e'''" or "'''ea'''t".)
Software and books with tapes are also important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or Arabic language school classes available.
If the speaker's native variety has feminine plural endings, they may be preserved, but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speaker's native variety, e.g.
The practical result of this is that MSA, like English and Standard Chinese, is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in CA for emphasis are rare.
There are various conflicting motivations involved, which leads to multiple systems.
Often a distinction is made between the suffixes  ('you', masc.)
(But note that Moroccan Arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters, instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence Moroccan Arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of Modern Standard Arabic.)
As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometimes known as IM Arabic.
Innovations of the Central Semitic languages—all maintained in Arabic—include:
** second-person singular feminine past-tense ''-ti'' and likewise ''anti'' 'you (fem.
Foreign words containing  may be transcribed with , , , , ,  or , mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of Arabic or the commonly diacriticized Arabic letter.
In late pre-Islamic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of Arabic emerged, already standardized in actual fact, which continued living its parallel life after literary Arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the Hijra, keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the ‘learned’ tradition (Classical Arabic).

for scholarly use, are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic script.
* '''' 'I had (something) written'
The phoneme  is represented by the Arabic letter '''' () and has many standard pronunciations.
Arabic has also borrowed words from many languages, including Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Persian and Syriac in early centuries, Kurdish in medieval times and contemporary European languages in modern times, mostly English and French.
Egyptian (metropolitan)
Southern Thamudic) were spoken.
The last two share important isoglosses with later forms of Arabic, leading scholars to theorize that Safaitic and Hismaic are in fact early forms of Arabic and that they should be considered Old Arabic.
When actually pronounced, one of three things happens:
In the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal ‘poetic koine’ distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the Bedouin dialects of Najd, probably in connection with the court of al-Ḥīra.
Academy of the Arabic Language is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the Arab League.
Some are interested in transliteration, i.e.
* '''' 'I correspond (with someone)'
** sometimes, first-person singular past-tense ''-tu''
when followed by a suffix, still sound as '''').
During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the Arab world, such as personal computers, the World Wide Web, email, bulletin board systems, IRC, instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging.
), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark '''', which indicates doubled consonants.
In actual pronunciation, doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants.
The emphatic consonant  was actually pronounced , or possibly —either way, a highly unusual sound.
For example, 24 is said "four and twenty" just like in the German language (''vierundzwanzig'') and Classical Hebrew, and '''1975''' is said "a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy" or, more eloquently, "five and seventy and nine-hundred and a thousand."
Charles Ferguson’s koine theory (Ferguson 1959), claims that the modern Arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprung up during the Islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times.
# ''t''-demonstratives
** Any remaining case endings (e.g.
It is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply ''even'' when a clitic suffix is added.
'I drank', '''' 'I said', '''' 'I spoke', where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix '''' is always used).
These less "scientific" tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs (like ''sh'' and ''kh'').
** sometimes, second-person masculine past-tense ''-ta'' and likewise ''anta'' 'you (masc.
* A final vowel, long or short, may not be stressed.
Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the "emphatic" counterparts of certain consonants.
Other systems (e.g.
Some of the spoken varieties are mutually unintelligible, both written and orally, and the varieties as a whole constitute a sociolinguistic language.
** Dual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis (similar to their use in the colloquial varieties); elsewhere, the plural endings are used (or feminine singular, if appropriate).
It is pronounced as a glottal stop  in several '''prestige dialects''', such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus.
** feminine plural ''-na''
** A short vowel (e.g., ''-i-'' or ''-ǝ-'') is consistently added, either between the second and third or the first and second consonants.
Many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred (especially /a/→/i/ and interchange /i/↔/u/).
For example, the numeral "3" may be used to represent the Arabic letter .
There are also two participles (active and passive) and a verbal noun, but no infinitive.
In some regions in Sudan and Yemen, as well as in some Sudanese and Yemeni dialects, it may be either  or , representing the original pronunciation of Classical Arabic.
Classical Arabic(liturgical or poetic only)
Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred to as nunation or tanwīn).
Furthermore, it is clear that the orthography of the Qurʾān was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic; rather, it shows the attempt on the part of writers to utilize a traditional writing system for recording a non-standardized form of Classical Arabic.
"Literary Arabic" and "Standard Arabic" ( '''') are less strictly defined terms that may refer to Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.
# The development of an internal passive.
* As a special exception, in Form VII and VIII verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable, despite the above rules: Hence '''' 'he subscribed' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced), '''' 'he subscribes' (whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced), '''' 'he should subscribe (juss.)'.
Many dialects with a modified pronunciation for  maintain the  pronunciation in certain words (often with religious or educational overtones) borrowed from the Classical language.
* '''' 'library, bookshop'
Being cursive by nature, unlike the Latin script, Arabic script is used to write down a verse of the Quran, a hadith, or simply a proverb.
** Or, a short vowel is never added, but consonants like ''r l m n'' occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a syllabic consonant (as in the English words "butter bottle bottom button").
Note also that in northern Egypt, where the Arabic letter '''' () is normally pronounced , a separate phoneme , which may be transcribed with , occurs in a small number of mostly non-Arabic loanwords, e.g.,  'jacket'.
In the earliest Nabataean inscriptions, Arabic names and idioms are attested.
Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the Latin script only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic script as an optional feature.
From a single root '''''', numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns:
** final ''-a'' in certain short words, e.g., ''laysa'' 'is not', ''sawfa'' (future-tense marker)
Allah, when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarized: بسم الله ''bismi l–lāh'' ).
Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in "construct state" and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article /al-/.
During the first Islamic century the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke Arabic as their mother tongue.
Unstressed short vowels, especially , are deleted in many contexts.
One of the current masters of the genre is Hassan Massoudy.
However, they ''are'' pronounced in adverbial accusative formations, e.g., '''' تَقْرِيبًا 'almost, approximately', '''' عَادَةً 'usually'.
It is also believed that the ancestors of the Modern South Arabian languages (non-Central Semitic languages) were also spoken in southern Arabia at this time.
This means that on purely linguistic grounds they would likely be considered to constitute more than one language, but are commonly grouped together as a single language for political or religious reasons (see below).
* The nunation endings ''-an -in -un'' are not pronounced.
# the use of ''f''- to introduce modal clauses
There are no cases of hiatus within a word (where two vowels occur next to each other, without an intervening consonant).
Ahmad al-Jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of Arabic on the eve of the conquests: Northern and Central (Al-Jallad 2009).
The so-called ''rajaz'' poetry of pre-Islamic is a good example of the use of a sophisticated variety of Middle Arabic.
Word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic.
Arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools, especially Muslim schools.
In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter, for example,  is written ; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it, for example, .
* Only one of the last three syllables may be stressed.
This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive:  '''' 'he accepted' vs.  '''' 'he kissed'.
* '''' 'it was written'
In Sana'a, Omani, and Bahrani  is pronounced .
In Moroccan Arabic, on the other hand, short /u/ triggers labialization of nearby consonants (especially velar consonants and uvular consonants), and then short /a i u/ all merge into /ǝ/, which is deleted in many contexts.
For example, the word for 'I wrote' is constructed by combining the root '''''' 'write' with the pattern '''''' 'I Xed' to form '''' 'I wrote'.
representing the ''pronunciation'' of Arabic.
* '''' 'I have (something) written'
In the Cairo (Egyptian Arabic) dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence '''' 'school', '''' 'Cairo'.
Arabic has a nonconcatenative "root-and-pattern" morphology: A root consists of a set of bare consonants (usually three), which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words.
Most dialects borrow "learned" words from the Standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words, but some dialects without interdental fricatives (particularly in Egypt and the Levant) render original  in borrowed words as .
Its emphatic counterpart, , may be written as '''D'''.
** Or, a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs, typically due to a violation of the sonority hierarchy (e.g., ''-rtn-'' is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster, but ''-trn-'' needs to be broken up).
In the northwestern frontier, the Nabataean dialect of Aramaic and its associated script had become familiar to the ancestors of the Arabs.
The following shows a paradigm of a regular Arabic verb, '''' 'to write'.
methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the Latin script.
During the colonial era, the European powers occupying Arab nations actively encouraged the public spread and use of colloquial Arabic dialects and suppressed the use and teaching of classical Arabic.
Numerals between three and ten show "chiasmic" agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.
representing the ''spelling'' of Arabic, while others focus on transcription, i.e.
Adjectives in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns.
Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem.
This caused great diversity in dialects throughout the near east, northern Africa, and even eastern European dialects of Arabic like Czech Arabic and Slavo-Anderski Arabic.
It is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position (with influence from the colloquial varieties).
CVVC and CVCC, are ''superheavy syllables''.
(A notable exception is the sounds  vs.  in Moroccan Arabic, because the former is pronounced as an affricate  but the latter is not.)
To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated.
In modern times, the educated upper classes in the Arab world have taken a nearly opposite view.
These rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced, vs. the normal situation where they are not pronounced, as in the above example of '''' 'library' in full pronunciation, but '''' 'library' in short pronunciation.
* '''' 'it was dictated'"
CVC and CVV, are termed ''heavy syllables'', while those with three morae, i.e.
:  '''' – ''a plum'';  '' – ''a truffle'' and so on.
The first comprehensive description of the ''ʿarabiyya'' "Arabic", Sībawayhi's ''al''-''Kitāb'', is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to the Qurʾān and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the ''ʿarabiyya''.
Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV)—and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC).
The two formal varieties are grouped together as Literary Arabic, which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of Islam.
(However, in words like '''' 'father' and '''' 'brother' with special long-vowel case endings in the construct state, the nominative is used everywhere, hence '''' 'father of', '''' 'brother of'.)
# The elimination of other prefix-conjugated mood/aspect forms (e.g., a present tense formed by doubling the middle root, a perfect formed by infixing a /t/ after the first root consonant, probably a jussive formed by a stress shift) in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix-conjugation forms (e.g., ''-u'' for indicative, ''-a'' for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, ''-an'' or ''-anna'' for energetic).
If this produces a sequence of three consonants, then one of the following happens, depending on the speaker's native colloquial variety:
There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it Arabic Chat Alphabet.
* All the rules for formal short pronunciation apply, except as follows.
In some Gulf dialects, it is palatalized to  or .
These are usually simpler to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems, and may lead to ambiguities, e.g.
Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives ,  (Proto-Semitic ), and :
This system is never used in MSA, even in the most formal of circumstances; instead, a significantly simplified system is used, approximating the system of the conservative spoken varieties.
It is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive  in Sudanese Arabic.
Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.6 billion Muslims.
Arabic is spoken in a wide arc stretching across Western Asia, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa.
It bears a strong relationship to vowel length.
MSA is the variety used in most current, printed Arabic publications, spoken by some of the Arabic media across North Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, and understood by most educated Arabic speakers.
The syllable types with two morae (units of time), i.e.
* The clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed, in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters.
* The numeral system in CA is complex and heavily tied in with the case system.
Some speakers velarize other occurrences of /l/ in MSA, in imitation of their spoken dialects.
In Iraqi Arabic it sometimes retains its original pronunciation and is sometimes rendered as a voiced velar plosive, depending on the word.
Throughout late antiquity, the use of the Ancient North Arabian scripts and their associated languages declines in Arabia and an Old Arabic written standard in a transitional Nabataeo-Arabic script emerges.
Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-Quranic era, especially in modern times.
The following changes occur:
* If the word occurs after another word ending in a vowel, the initial vowel of the word is elided, e.g.,  '''' 'house of the director' .
* '''' 'I dictated'

The literary language, called Modern Standard Arabic or Literary Arabic, is the only official form of Arabic.
Doubled consonants count as two consonants: '''' 'magazine', '''' "place".
Superheavy syllables in Classical Arabic occur in only two places: at the end of the sentence (due to pausal pronunciation) and in words such as  '''' 'hot',  '''' 'stuff, substance',  '''' 'they disputed with each other', where a long '''' occurs before two identical consonants (a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost).
Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects.
Classical Arabic is the language found in the Quran, used from the period of Pre-Islamic Arabia to that of the Abbasid Caliphate.
However, the following short vowels ''are'' pronounced:
Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in European languages, mainly Spanish and Portuguese owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the Iberian Peninsula, referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus.
