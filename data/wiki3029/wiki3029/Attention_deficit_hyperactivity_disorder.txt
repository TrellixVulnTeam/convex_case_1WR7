Although it causes significant impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.
Methylphenidate appears to improve symptoms as reported by teachers and parents.
Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the medicalization of deviant behavior, that is, the turning of the previously  issue of school performance into a medical one.
Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder, at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms.
Symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into "inner restlessness" in teens and adults with ADHD.

ADHD management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling, lifestyle changes, and medications.
Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency.

The latter is sometimes referred to as ''hyperkinetic syndrome''.
The posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in ADHD individuals compared to controls.
In children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided prefrontal cortex.
Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with less severe symptoms.
The diagnosis of ADHD can represent family dysfunction or a poor educational system rather than an individual problem.
Previously it was thought that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology but it appears that the elevated numbers are due to adaptation to exposure to stimulants.
Evolution may have played a role in the high rates of ADHD, particularly hyperactive and impulsive traits in males.
Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD.
* Seem to not be listening when spoken to
One study found that&nbsp;80% of individuals with ADHD were impaired in at least one executive function task, compared to&nbsp;50% for individuals without ADHD.
This leads to the current situation where the DSM-IV arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times higher than those obtained with the ICD-10.
The most important factor in reducing later psychological problems, such as  major depression, criminality, school failure, and substance use disorders is formation of friendships with people who are not involved in delinquent activities.

The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other disorders, as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within the normal-range.
ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a person's childhood behavioral and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms.
