Also many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ELL students.
A well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer, and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool.
When the term "learning disorder" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.
Skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem.
Difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them, such as the sound of the teacher's voice in a classroom setting.
'''Learning disability''' is a classification that includes several areas of functioning in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors.
The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused.
In the United States there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services, specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations.
The NJCLD used the term 'learning disability' to indicate a discrepancy between a child’s apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement.
For example, in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with English language learners.
Neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers.
“The cultural repertoires of students from cultural learning disorder backgrounds have an impact on their learning, school progress, and behavior in the classroom”.
Sternberg has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities.
With an unclear diagnosis many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system.
This is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are be unable to clearly asses if a student’s delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability.
If a teacher ignores a student’s culturally diverse background, the student will suffer in the class.
School psychologists and other qualified professionals quite often help design the intervention and coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents.
Various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is English language.
While many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time, or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability.
This information is vital because it has been and will continue to effect both students and how educators approach teaching methods.
Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment.
In the UK, terms such as specific learning difficulty (SpLD), developmental dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder and dyscalculia are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as "learning disabilities".
While ''learning disability, learning disorder'' and ''learning difficulty'' are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways.
Also an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments.
Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.
The distinction between race/ethnicity and SES is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need.
Learning disability on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (psychologist, pediatrician, etc.).
The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability.
RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.
Researchers working within a social model of disability assert that there are social or structural causes of disability or the assignation of the label of disability, and even that disability is entirely socially constructed.
In the 1980s, NJCLD therefore defined the term learning disability as: a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities.
Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called "Tier 1 instruction") and a more intensive intervention (often called "Tier 2" intervention) are considered "nonresponders."
Summarily, because the risk of identification for White students who have low SES is similar to that of Black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities.
SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as intellectual disability, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits."
Thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless.This ruling is also supported by English language development services provided in schools, but unfortunately these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider.
The term "Developmental Dyslexia" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one.
Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor "number sense".
These students may then act out and not excel in the classroom and will therefore be misdiagnosed: “Overall, the data indicates that there is a persistent concern regarding the misdiagnosis and inappropriate placement of students from diverse backgrounds in special education classes since the 1975”.
A poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension.
Much current research has focused on a treatment-oriented diagnostic process known as response to intervention (RTI).
Doing so will give the student a space to concentrate and not be bothered by the noise of the other students.
Several difficulties existed, however, with the NJCLD standard of defining learning disability.
Individuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship.
For example, they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched.
The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term "disorder" rather than "disability".)
The conditions can co-occur.
Difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell.
Currently there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing English language learners (ELL) with specific learning disabilities (SLD).
: This is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted, categorized, placed in a sequence, or related to previous learning.
If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals' motor coordination, a diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder should be considered.
Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria.
Examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardised tests to take account of special needs.
Unfortunately in the United States there are no set policies have been enforced to mandate that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families.
Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), mathematics (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).
People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things.
While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding, others have argued that racial/ethnic minorities are overidentified because of their lower status.
This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies.
Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests–2nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment.
This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may in turn result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services.
Reading disorders can be helped and there are a lot of ways to help a student suffering with dyslexia.
In the UK, the term "learning disability" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized cognitive impairment.
their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e.
: Information comes out of the brain either through words, that is, language output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing.
Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex.
However, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem.
Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.
This can discourage the student from wanting to read.
In Japan, acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development, and has improved drastically in the last decade.
It seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential (as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors).
In the United States and Canada, the terms '''learning disability''' and '''learning disorder''' (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to speak, listen, read, write, spell, reason, organize information, and do math.
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities.
Additionally specifically in regards to ELL's the supreme court ruling Lau v. Nichols (1974) ruled that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity.
It has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations.
Demographers in the United State report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the United States over the past two decades.
By not taking into account specific cognitive processes, RTI fails to inform educators about a students' relative strengths and weaknesses Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention.
Teachers, parents and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners.
Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers.
Many school districts do not have the proper personnel that are able to communicate with this population.
Learning disability theory is founded in the medical model of disability, in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin.
It can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons.
A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis.
SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes.
The DSM-5 does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics and written expression.
Students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement.
Most memory difficulties occur with one's short-term memory, which can make it difficult to learn new material without more repetitions than usual.
The purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioural issues or language delays.
There are studies that suggest people with ADHD generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities.
sensory impairment, intellectual disability, social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g.
For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES Whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES Whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES.
This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities.
Representatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD).
Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD.
If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability.
These factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty.
Deficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities.
their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).
cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, psychogenic factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.
Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e.
Additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is un aware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the U.S dealing could be potentially dealing with.
However, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with Down's syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms.
Another aspect to pay attention to is to create a quiet area of the classroom.
By a number of organizations, the term "dysgraphia" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression.
Students were commonly pushed toward testing, based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education.
One such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability.
These contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students behaviours and compares them to standardized norms.
Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language.
Scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with ADHD.
''The Lancet'' defines 'learning disability' as a "significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood," and states that roughly one in 50 British adults have one.
Difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape, position, or size of items seen.
Since the turn of the 19th century, education in the United States has been geared toward producing citizens who can effectively contribute to a capitalistic society, with a cultural premium on efficiency and science.
An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD.
Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities.
He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports.
Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g.
This demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.
Schools in the United States have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country, including undocumented students.
A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.
The unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive and process information.
Those who respond will not require further intervention.
In the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits.
People diagnosed with ADHD sometimes have impaired learning.
A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD.
Before the term "dyslexia" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as "word blindness."
Given the "difficulty learning in a typical manner", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner.
Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area.
Instead, it is a single diagnosis criteria describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.
People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.
These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction.
Educators have only recently started to look into the effects of culture on learning disabilities.
A compilation of these test are used to assess whether an ELL student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors.
Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a "Learning Difference", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping.
Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously.
These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability.
A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension.
Also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with ADHD be academically successful.
Current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports.
On the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction.
Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.
Though, historically, ADHD was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning.
There can be problems with sequencing, which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception.
Another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity.
: Problems with memory can occur with short-term or working memory, or with long-term memory.
In the UK, the term ''dual diagnosis'' is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.

It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21.
The effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well.
Also, a positive perception of one’s physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem.
The 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:
: "Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD).
In the bigger picture, these points demonstrate how the label of disability is socially constructed and represents a lack of fit between Western conceptions of educational institutions and proper students.
Sometimes called dyscalculia, a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page.
The landmark Supreme Court ruling Plyler v. Doe (1982) grants all children no matter legal status to a free education.
Similarities were noted between the behaviors of “brain-injured” and lower class students as early as the 1960s.
Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills.
Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and is not driven by psychologists, reading specialists, or special educators.
It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.
Some research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs, since it is being shown to have a strong effect on "executive functions" required for learning.
Many studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem.
The term "learning disability" does not exist in DSM-IV, but it has been added to DSM-5.
Such difficulties include answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak.
: This is the information perceived through the senses, such as visual and auditory perception.
Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success.
This has not as yet affected any official definitions.
People with fine motor difficulties may have trouble with handwriting, buttoning shirts, or tying shoelaces.
It is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools.
Reading disorder is the most common learning disability.
Researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label.
This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability.
It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties.
The NJCLD notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.
Learning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.
In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities.
Emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors.
More agrarian cultures, for example, do not even use learning ability as a measure of adult adequacy, whereas the diagnosis of learning disabilities is prevalent in Western capitalistic societies because of the high value placed on speed, literacy, and numeracy in both the labor force and school system.
Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV&nbsp;– Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency.
Silent reading time is good for all students, however, will give the student dealing with dyslexia more time to practice on their own, and if they need help they can always ask their teacher.
These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis.
The first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999, and in 2001, the Enrichment Project for the Support System for Students with Learning Disabilities was established.
The process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction.
When ELLs are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities.
A primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance.
This conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning.
Some children appear to be unable to process tactile input.
Students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence, unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week, able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning, or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the "big picture."
The issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy.
Teachers need to focus on giving students extra time to read silently in class, and to never force them to do it out loud in front of the whole class.
Learning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude.
They may also have trouble running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle.
It is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in English language learners (ELL) differs.

Since then, significant efforts have been to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.
One of the clearest indications of the social roots of learning disabilities is the disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low socioeconomic status (SES).
:Learning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).
Individuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan.
The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual.
Linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ELLs' growth in language and academically.
Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress.
