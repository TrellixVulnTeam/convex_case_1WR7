Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography.
The differences between the perspective rendering is actually not due to the focal length by itself, but by the distance between the subjects and the camera.
Shot and released in 1998, ''The Last Broadcast'' is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.
The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words  (''kinema''), meaning "movement, motion" and γράφειν, ''graphein'' "to record", together meaning "recording motion."
Film editing plays a much stronger role in this manipulation, but frame rate selection in the photography of the original action is also a contributing factor to altering time.
Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting.
The first commonly used anamorphic format was CinemaScope, which used a 2.35 aspect ratio, although it was originally 2.55.
A large or deep depth of field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow depth of field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens.
As a result, the cinematographer's job also includes personnel management and logistical organization.
Certain "epic" or adventure movies utilized the anamorphic 2.39.
In the same year, the short film A Visit to the Seaside became the first natural color movie to be publicly presented.
This speed of presentation does not vary.
For years, mainstream cinematographers were limited to using the Academy ratio, but in the 1950s, thanks to the popularity of Cinerama, widescreen ratios were introduced in an effort to pull audiences back into the theater and away from their home television sets.
In 1896, movie theaters were open in: France (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille); Italy (Rome, Milan, Naples, Genoa, Venice, Bologna, Forlì); Belgium (Brussels); and Great Britain (London).
In the 2010s, color films were largely superseded by color digital cinematography.
Filters can be used in front of the lens or, in some cases, behind the lens for different effects.
Given the in-depth knowledge a cinematographer requires not only of his or her own craft but also that of other personnel, formal tuition in analogue or digital filmmaking can be advantageous.
Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in 1905.
(Such movies are referred to as ''colored'' and not ''color''.)
For example, Charlie Chaplin's ''Modern Times'' was shot at "silent speed" (18 fps) but projected at "sound speed" (24 fps), which makes the slapstick action appear even more frenetic.
In the 1970s, cinema mostly switched over to color films as they became more economical and viable.
W K. L. Dickson, working under the direction of Thomas Alva Edison, was the first to design a successful apparatus, the Kinetograph, patented in 1891.
The 1896 movie The Execution of Mary Stuart shows an actor dressed as the queen placing her head on the execution block in front of a small group of bystanders in Elizabethan dress.
As digital technology improved, movie studios began increasingly shifting towards digital cinematography.
The techniques used by the film laboratory to process the film stock can also offer a considerable variance in the image produced.
The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse's, and each camera shutter was controlled by a trip wire triggered by the horse's hooves.
If a cinematographer shoots a person diving into a pool at 96 frames per second, and that image is played back at 24 frames per second, the presentation will take 4 times as long as the actual event.
The effort met with very little success.
Since the cost of color films was substantially higher, most movies were produced in monochrome until the 1970s.
This film shows a woman being made to vanish by using the same stop motion technique as the earlier Edison film.
The ghost effect was done by draping the set in black velvet after the main action had been shot, and then re-exposing the negative with the actor playing the ghost going through the actions at the appropriate point.
It is also bulkier and more strenuous to deal with movie cameras, and it involves a more complex array of choices.
The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906.
The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.
Today, this is a standard for high-definition video and for widescreen television.
Georges Méliès first used superimposition on a dark background in ''La Caverne maudite (The Cave of the Demons)'' made a couple of months later in 1898, and elaborated it with multiple superimpositions in the one shot in ''Un Homme de têtes (The Four Troublesome Heads)''.
The soft overall light without real shadows that this arrangement produced, and which also exists naturally on lightly overcast days, was to become the basis for film lighting in film studios for the next decade.
This had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct ray of the sun on sunny days.
Almost all short silent films from the 1880s to the 1910s, almost all feature-length silent films from the 1910s to the 1920s, and most feature-length sound films from the 1920s to the 1970s, were produced in monochrome.
This he did by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.
Cinematography, however, has a temporal aspect (see persistence of vision), unlike still photography, which is purely a single still image.
Certain cinematographers, such as Christopher Doyle, are well known for their innovative use of filters.
One camera can achieve all the various looks of different emulsions.
However, unlike one's eye, a cinematographer can select different lenses for different purposes.
The first known of these was a film shot by a Lumière cameraman from the back platform of a train leaving Jerusalem in 1896, and by 1898 there were a number of films shot from moving trains.
In the film industry, the '''cinematographer''' is responsible for the technical aspects of the images (lighting, lens choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film selection), but works closely with the director to ensure that the artistic aesthetics are supporting the director's vision of the story being told.
With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent display or processing.
Filters, such as diffusion filters or color-effect filters, are also widely used to enhance mood or dramatic effects.
In the theater it is 24 frames per second, in NTSC (US) Television it is 30 frames per second (29.97 to be exact), in PAL (Europe) television it is 25 frames per second.
Numerous aspects contribute to the art of cinematography, including:
Although it was never played back at speed to create motion, this was the first step towards motion pictures.
The first special effects in the cinema were created while the film was being shot.
Shots taken using such a "panning" head were also referred to as "panoramas" in the film catalogues of the first decade of the cinema.
Most cameras can also be handheld, that is held in the hands of the camera operator who moves from one position to another while filming the action.
The art of lighting for cinematography goes far beyond basic exposure, however, into the essence of visual storytelling.
Many of these decisions are similar to what a photographer needs to note when taking a picture: the cinematographer controls the film choice itself (from a range of available stocks with varying sensitivities to light and color), the selection of lens focal lengths, aperture exposure and focus.
IMAX and other 70mm formats gained popularity.
In the 1990s, with the advent of high-definition video, television engineers created the 1.78 (16:9) ratio as a mathematical compromise between the theatrical standard of 1.85 and television's 1.33, as it was not practical to produce a traditional CRT television tube with a width of 1.85.
As in other photography, the control of the exposed image is done in the lens with the control of the diaphragm aperture.
The introduction of film into scientific fields allowed for not only the viewing "new images and objects, such as cells and natural objects, but also the viewing of them in real time", whereas prior to the invention of moving pictures, scientists and doctors alike had to rely on hand drawn sketches of human anatomy and its microorganisms.
A person in the distance is shown as much smaller while someone in the front will loom large.
The standard pattern for early film studios was provided by the studio which Georges Méliès had built in 1897.
In 1897, Robert W. Paul had the first real rotating camera head made to put on a tripod, so that he could follow the passing processions of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in one uninterrupted shot.
As such a cinematographer often needs to work co-operatively with more people than does a photographer, who could frequently function as a single person.
Cinematography can begin with digital image sensor or rolls of film.
Techniques range from the most basic movements of panning (horizontal shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like turning your head side-to-side) and tilting (vertical shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like tipping your head back to look at the sky or down to look at the ground) to dollying (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it closer or farther from the subject), tracking (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it to the left or right), craning (moving the camera in a vertical position; being able to lift it off the ground as well as swing it side-to-side from a fixed base position), and combinations of the above.
However, in comparison to other technological advances of the time, the arrival of color photography was a relatively slow process.
In 1908, kinemacolor was introduced.
In ''Citizen Kane'' (1941), cinematographer Gregg Toland and director Orson Welles used tighter apertures to create every detail of the foreground and background of the sets in sharp focus.
The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.
This trick was worked by stopping the camera and replacing the actor with a dummy, then restarting the camera before the axe falls.
The earliest such example is the hand-tinted Annabelle Serpentine Dance in 1895 by Edison Manufacturing Company.
The first film cameras were fastened directly to the head of a tripod or other support, with only the crudest kind of leveling devices provided, in the manner of the still-camera tripod heads of the period.
Then, the smaller the image is, the more depth of field is obtained, for the same field of view.
Personal stabilizing platforms came into being in the late 1970s through the invention of Garrett Brown, which became known as the Steadicam.
For proper selection, the cinematographer needs that all lenses be engraved with T-Stop, not f-stop, so that the eventual light loss due to the glass doesn't affect the exposure control when setting it using the usual meters.
The executioner brings his axe down, and the queen's severed head drops onto the ground.
The cinematographers are the heads of the camera, grip and lighting crew on a set, and for this reason they are often called '''directors of photography''' or '''DPs'''.
Deep focus became a popular cinematographic device from the 1940s onwards in Hollywood.
In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in the U.S.
Later, optical and digital effects were developed so that editors and visual effects artists could more tightly control the process by manipulating the film in post-production.
By the late 1920s most of the movies produced were sound films.
Likewise, the vision, which appeared within a circular vignette or matte, was similarly superimposed over a black area in the backdrop to the scene, rather than over a part of the set with detail in it, so that nothing appeared through the image, which seemed quite solid.
CinemaScope was used from 1953 to 1967, but due to technical flaws in the design and its ownership by Fox, several third-party companies, led by Panavision's technical improvements in the 1950s, dominated the anamorphic cine lens market.Changes to SMPTE projection standards altered the projected ratio from 2.35 to 2.39 in 1970, although this did not change anything regarding the photographic anamorphic standards; all changes in respect to the aspect ratio of anamorphic 35&nbsp;mm photography are specific to camera or projector gate sizes, not the optical system.
In motion pictures the manipulation of time and space is a considerable contributing factor to the narrative storytelling tools.
As he comes out of the warehouse "load-point", the camera zooms in to Neo at normal speed but as it gets closer to Neo's face, time seems to slow down, foreshadowing the manipulation of time itself within the Matrix later in the movie.
In 1998, with the introduction of HDCAM recorders and 1920 × 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on CCD technology, the idea, now re-branded as "digital cinematography," began to gain traction in the market.
Here, a small boy is shown knocking down a castle just constructed by a little girl out of children's building blocks.
The career progression usually involves climbing up the ladder from seconding, firsting, eventually to operating the camera.
French biologist and filmmaker Jean Painleve lobbied heavily for the use of film in the scientific field, as the new medium was more efficient in capturing and documenting the behavior, movement, and environment of microorganisms, cells, and bacteria, than the naked eye.
Variation in focal length is one of the chief benefits.
The first films using this were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter'', the latter which  showed a sign painter lettering a sign, and then the painting on the sign vanishing under the painter's brush.
Early movies were not actually color movies, since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards.
"One of the twin brothers returns home from shooting in the Corsican mountains, and is visited by the ghost of the other twin.
Therefore, 70mm has less depth of field than 35mm for a given field of view, 16mm more than 35mm, and video cameras even more depth of field than 16mm.
Europe and Asia opted for 1.66 at first, although 1.85 has largely permeated these markets in recent decades.
Although listed under the general heading of "panoramas" in the sales catalogues of the time, those films shot straight forward from in front of a railway engine were usually specifically referred to as "phantom rides".
The choice of the aperture also affects image quality (aberrations) and depth of field.
Smith used this technique again in ''Santa Claus'' (1898).
However, this led to one of the earliest digitally shot feature movies, ''Julia and Julia'', being produced in 1987.
If one considers the field of view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same field of view.
Many different proprietary photographic systems were invented and utilized in the 1950s to create widescreen movies, but one dominated film: the anamorphic process, which optically squeezes the image to photograph twice the horizontal area to the same size vertical as standard "spherical" lenses.
However, by varying the speed at which the image is captured, various effects can be created knowing that the faster or slower recorded image will be played at a constant speed.
Cecil Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the Seidlitz Powder'' (1901), in which a naïve Red Indian eats a lot of the fizzy stomach medicine, causing his stomach to expand and then he then leaps around balloon-like.
Wide-angle lenses have short focal lengths and make spatial distances more obvious.
The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into a visible image.
On smaller productions it is common for one person to perform all these functions alone.
Since the 2010s, digital cinematography has become the dominant form of cinematography after largely superseding film cinematography.
The opposite speed-ramping is done in ''The Matrix'' when Neo re-enters the Matrix for the first time to see the Oracle.
Extreme slow motion, capturing many thousands of frames per second can present things normally invisible to the human eye, such as bullets in flight and shockwaves travelling through media, a potentially powerful cinematographical technique.
However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33).
Today, the trend is for more shallow focus.
This film was among those exported to Europe with the first Kinetoscope machines in 1895, and was seen by Georges Méliès, who was putting on magic shows in his Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris at the time.
The inverse of this, if an image is captured at speeds above that at which they will be presented, the effect is to greatly slow down (slow motion) the image.
Depth of field (not to be confused with depth of focus) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance.
Digital image adjustments such as ISO and contrast  are executed by estimating the same adjustments that would take place if actual film were in use, and are thus vulnerable to the camera's sensor designers perceptions of various film stocks and image adjustment parameters.
The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make close-ups without physically moving the camera.
Changing the focal length only while keeping the same camera position doesn't affect perspective but the camera angle of view only.
Early cinematographers often faced problems that were not common to other graphic artists because of the element of motion.
Motion picture images are presented to an audience at a constant speed.
For example, someone pushing a door open and walking out into the street would appear to start off in slow-motion, but in a few seconds later within the same shot the person would appear to walk in "realtime" (normal speed).
Film cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s, when digital cinematography became dominant.
Nine years later, in 1882, French scientist Étienne-Jules Marey invented a chronophotographic gun, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording all the frames of the same picture.
The Steadicam is a body harness and stabilization arm that connects to the camera, supporting the camera while isolating it from the operator's body movements.
During the silent era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square 1:1, all the way up to the extreme widescreen 4:1 Polyvision.
Cecil Hepworth improved upon this technique by printing the negative of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so that in the production of the print the original action was exactly reversed.
Monochrome cinematography is still used by cinematographers for artistic reasons or for specific applications.
Most photographic filters are made up of two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass.
The results of this work were first shown in public in 1893, using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the Kinetoscope.
As does the human eye, the camera creates perspective and spatial relations with the rest of the world.
Some techniques that can be used are push processing, bleach bypass and cross processing.
Machine-based tinting later became popular.
A title then appears, saying "Reversed", and the action is repeated in reverse, so that the castle re-erects itself under his blows.
Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.
He took up filmmaking in 1896, and after making imitations of other films from Edison, Lumière, and Robert Paul, he made ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''.
Cinematography can not only depict a moving subject but can use a camera, which represents the audience's viewpoint or perspective, that moves during the course of filming.
In May 1999 George Lucas challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in ''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace''.
Lighting contributes considerably to the emotional response an audience has watching a motion picture.
If a cinematographer sets a camera to expose one frame every minute for four hours, and then that footage is projected at 24 frames per second, a four-hour event will take 10 seconds to present, and one can present the events of a whole day (24 hours) in just one minute.
For instance, time-lapse photography is created by exposing an image at an extremely slow rate.
The invention of the talking picture further increased the demand for the use of color photography.
Kodachrome was introduced in 1935.
Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in two-tone color.
After the "widescreen wars" of the 1950s, the motion-picture industry settled into 1.85 as a standard for theatrical projection in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Most of modern cinema uses digital cinematography and has no film stocks , but the cameras themselves can be adjusted in ways that go far beyond the abilities of one particular film stock.
By controlling the temperature and varying the duration in which the film is soaked in the development chemicals, and by skipping certain chemical processes (or partially skipping all of them), cinematographers can achieve very different looks from a single film stock in the laboratory.
Speed ramping, or simply "ramping", is a process whereby the capture frame rate of the camera changes over time.
In the following year, Charles Francis Jenkins and his projector, the Phantoscope, made a successful audience viewing while Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film, in Paris in December 1895.
To the Corsican's amazement, the duel and death of his brother are vividly depicted in the vision, and overcome by his feelings, he falls to the floor just as his mother enters the room."
These new widescreen formats provided cinematographers a wider frame within which to compose their images.
This movement plays a considerable role in the emotional language of film images and the audience's emotional reaction to the action.
On June 19, 1873, Eadweard Muybridge successfully photographed a horse named "Sallie Gardner" in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras.
In 1917, the earliest version of Technicolor was introduced.
In 1932 a new standard was introduced, the Academy ratio of 1.37, by means of thickening the frame line.
This device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a worm gear driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year.
Beginning in the late 1980s, Sony began marketing the concept of "electronic cinematography," utilizing its analog Sony HDVS professional video cameras.
After the Steadicam patent expired in the early 1990s, many other companies began manufacturing their concept of the personal camera stabilizer.
He created further variations in subsequent films.
They were 21&nbsp;inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride, taking pictures at one thousandth of a second.
Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for "blockbusters."
After this, Georges Méliès made many single shot films using this trick over the next couple of years.
The late nineteenth to the early twentieth century brought rise to the use of film not only for entertainment purposes, but for scientific exploration as well.
The word used to refer to the art, process, or job of filming movies, but later its meaning was restricted to "motion picture photography."
The focal length of the lens determines the angle of view and, therefore, the field of view.
The larger the film gauge, the higher the overall image resolution clarity and technical quality.
As videographers try to emulate the look of 35&nbsp;mm film with digital cameras, this is one issue of frustration - excessive depth of field with digital cameras and using additional optical devices to reduce that depth of field.
Light is necessary to create an image exposure on a frame of film or on a digital target (CCD, etc.).
On the other hand, long focus lenses reduce such exaggerations, depicting far-off objects as seemingly close together and flattening perspective.
In British tradition, if the DOP actually operates the camera him/herself they are called the ''cinematographer''.
In the case of color filters, there is often a translucent color medium pressed between two planes of optical glass.
Focal length and diaphragm aperture affect the depth of field of a scene — that is, how much the background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in "acceptable focus" (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target.
By the 1970s, most movies were color films.
This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent celluloid strip 35&nbsp;mm wide.
In black-and-white photography, color filters are used somewhat counter intuitively; for instance a yellow filter, which cuts down on blue wavelengths of light, can be used to darken a daylight sky (by eliminating blue light from hitting the film, thus greatly underexposing the mostly blue sky), while not biasing most human flesh tone.
Color filters work by blocking out certain color wavelengths of light from reaching the film.
Hepworth made ''The Bathers'' in 1900, in which bathers who have undressed and jumped into the water appear to spring backwards out of it, and have their clothes magically fly back onto their bodies.
A zoom lens allows a camera operator to change their focal length within a shot or quickly between setups for shots.
After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural color.
This was done by cranking the camera faster than the normal 16 frames per second giving the first "slow motion" effect.
The earliest film cameras were thus effectively fixed during the shot, and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle.
With color film, this works very intuitively wherein a blue filter will cut down on the passage of red, orange and yellow light and create a blue tint on the film.
As prime lenses offer greater optical quality and are "faster" (larger aperture openings, usable in less light) than zoom lenses, they are often employed in professional cinematography over zoom lenses.
Therefore, the use of different focal lengths in combination with different camera to subject distances creates these different rendering.
Super 8&nbsp;mm, Super 16&nbsp;mm and Super 35&nbsp;mm all utilize more of the overall film area for the image than their "regular" non-super counterparts.
Directors of photography make many creative and interpretive decisions during the course of their work, from pre-production to post-production, all of which affect the overall feel and look of the motion picture.
The selection of a film stock is one of the first decisions made in preparing a typical film production.
Smith initiated the technique of reverse motion and also improved the quality of self-motivating images.
This practice is known as deep focus.
Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.
The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900.
Certain scenes or even types of filmmaking, however, may require the use of zooms for speed or ease of use, as well as shots involving a zoom move.
Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s.
Wide screen formats were first experimented with in the 1950s.
Cinematographers can choose from a range of wide-angle lenses, "normal" lenses and long focus lenses, as well as macro lenses and other special effect lens systems such as borescope lenses.
By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*.
Robert Paul's ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899), had the camera turn so slowly that when the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed.
They can provide varying degrees of color sensitivity, image contrast, light sensitivity and so on.
Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific applications or out of fondness of the format.
To change the plane of focus from one object or character to another within a shot is commonly known as a ''rack focus''.
The ASC defines cinematography as:a creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event.
