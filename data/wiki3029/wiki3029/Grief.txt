Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill and it was not until much later in her career did she give into the notion that it could be applied to those grieving.
It is important to recognize the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects.
It is an effort to stay above the grief.
The American family's approach to grieving was depicted in "The Grief Committee", by T. Glen Coughlin.
Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle.
In Bonanno's book, "The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss" (ISBN 978-0-465-01360-9), he summarizes his research.
Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one."
That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners.
However, the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other's lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other's identities; with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor's identity because “your identity is based on having them there.”
The symptoms seen in complicated grief are specific because the symptoms seem to be a combination of the symptoms found in separation as well as traumatic distress.
Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.
One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population.
Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.
But when a baby chimpanzee or gorilla dies, the mother will carry the body around for several days before it may finally be able to move on without it; this behavior has been observed in other primates, as well.
This usually occurs in mammals, typically between a mother and in the event of its offspring's death.
Colin Murray Parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death.
Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), formerly known as complicated grief disorder (CGD), is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long-term physical and psycho-social dysfunction.
These symptoms were correlated with cancer, hypertension, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, increased smoking, and sleep impairments at around six months after spousal death.
The loss of a sibling can be a devastating life event.
In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss.
The five stages are:
Relocations can cause children significant grief, particularly if they are combined with other difficult circumstances, such as neglectful and/or abusive parental behaviors, other significant losses, etc.
When a parent or caregiver dies or leaves, children may have symptoms of psychopathology, but they are less severe than in children with major depression.
Other researchers such as Randolph Nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory.
The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient.
Adolescents may respond by delinquency, or oppositely become "over-achievers": repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing, computer games, etc.
When the reaction turns into complicated grief, however, the feelings of loss become incapacitating and continue even though time passes.
If siblings were not on good terms or close with each other, then intense feelings of guilt may ensue on the part of the surviving sibling (guilt may also ensue for having survived, not being able to prevent the death, having argued with their sibling, etc.)
When an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be "timely" and to be a normative life course event.
Critics of including the diagnosis of complicated grief in the DSM-5 say that doing so will constitute characterizing a natural response as a pathology, and will result in wholesale medicating of people who are essentially normal.
Emotional unsteadiness, bouts of crying, helplessness and hopelessness are just a small sample of what a widow or widower can expect to face.
* '''Resilience''': "The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning" as well as "the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions."
Complicated grief is characterised by an extended grieving period and other criteria, including mental and physical impairments.
Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed.
But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function.
A spouse often becomes part of the other in a unique way:  many widows and widowers describe losing 'half' of themselves.
A factor is the manner in which the spouse died.
Kubler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving.
* '''Chronic dysfunction''': Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer.
On set #1, write your five most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your five most valued possessions; on set #3, write your five most loved people.
Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child.
However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated.
For a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may result in long-term psychological harm.
This model found empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al.
Grief is a natural response to loss.
The Mayo Clinic states that with normal grief the feelings of loss are evident.
Bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be "taught" through specialized programs and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.
Then “lose” them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all.
found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent.
The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling.
In the study "Bereavement and Late-Life Depression: Grief and its Complications in the Elderly" six subjects with symptoms of complicated grief were given a dose of Paroxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and showed a 50% decrease in their symptoms within a three-month period.
Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others.
Depression and loneliness are very common.
Feeling bitter and resentful are normal feelings for the spouse who is "left behind".
Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often looks toward a future together (even into retirement).
Pressing people to cry or retell the experience of a loss can be harmful.
Responses or actions in the affected person, called "coping ugly" by researcher George Bonanno, may seem counter-intuitive or even appear dysfunctional, e.g., celebratory responses, laughter, or self-serving bias in interpreting events.
'''Grief''' is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed.
John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system.
These inhibitors have been found to reduce intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and hyperarousal that are associated with complicated grief.
Among those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivity to reminders of their loss.
Another notable example is Koko, a gorilla that uses sign language, who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.
Researchers have not found evidence of delayed grief, but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon.
The theory holds that the stages are a part of the framework that helps people learn to live without what they lost.
A treatment that has been found beneficial in dealing with the symptoms associated with complicated grief is the use of serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors such as Paroxetine.
Lay out three sets of five pieces of note paper on a table.
Adolescents valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss.

Some believe that those who have a high degree of cognitive impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment.
The stages model, which came about in the 1960s, is a theory based on observation of people who are dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one.
Since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from any source outside the family unit, this is likely to be experienced as disenfranchised grief.
The sibling relationship is a unique one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role and place in the family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits.
An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead comrade, pause for thought for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.
The days, months and years after the loss of a spouse will never be the same and learning to live without them may be harder than one would expect.
Each culture specifies manners such as rituals, styles of dress, or other habits, as well as attitudes, in which the bereaved are encouraged or expected to take part.
Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.
These responses were correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex.
It recommends contacting a medical professional if "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life."
A failure to accept and deal with loss will only result in further pain and suffering.
In the case of the amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity.
In the Hopi of Arizona, the deceased are quickly forgotten and life continues on.
It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.

Suicide rates are growing worldwide and over the last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is "at-risk".
One of the best ways to grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives.
Intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.
Death of a child can take the form of a loss in infancy such as miscarriage or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child.

(The story is taught in the course, The Politics of Mourning: Grief Management in a Cross-Cultural Fiction.
By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process.
However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality.

Childhood loss as mentioned before can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide, especially in the adolescent period.
After a long marriage, at older ages, the elderly may find it a very difficult assimilation to begin anew; but at younger ages as well, a marriage relationship was often a profound one for the survivor.
It may be found among survivors of combat, natural disasters, epidemics, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations such as among those whose colleagues are laid off.
This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it.
In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
His subjects suffered losses through war, terrorism, deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, sexual abuse, childhood diagnoses of AIDS, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.
* '''Delayed grief or trauma''': When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later.
The survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence.
From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new social partners, informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments.
Shear and colleagues found an effective treatment for complicated grief, by treating the reactions in the same way as trauma reactions.
Other animals, such as elephants, have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant.
Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research.
Individuals with PGD experience severe grief symptoms for at least six months and are stuck in a maladaptive state.
From an evolutionary perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, and it is not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer.
Science has found that some healthy people who are grieving do not spontaneously talk about the loss.
Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and vagus nerve is similarly implicated in the experience of heartbreak whether due to social rejection or bereavement.

This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief.
They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them.
Those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief.

This suggests that grief can cause stress, and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the frontal lobe.
An adult may be expected to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions.
The grief, in all events, however, can always be of the most profound sort to the widow and the widower.
Adult siblings eventually expect the loss of aging parents, the only other people who have been an integral part of their lives since birth, but they do not expect to lose their siblings early; as a result, when a sibling dies, the surviving sibling may experience a longer period of shock and disbelief.
While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to loss.

In Japan, maintenance of ties with the deceased is accepted and carried out through religious rituals.
It has also been found, however, that crying and talking about the loss is not the only healthy response and, if forced or excessive, can be harmful.
Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child).
For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished.
In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.

The theory holds that the stages are not stops on a linear time line of grief.
In those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss, studies of fMRI scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter.
Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.
Most birds seem to lack the perception of grief - for example, Mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked.
