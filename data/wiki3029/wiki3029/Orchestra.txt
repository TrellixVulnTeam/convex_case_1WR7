These were "at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme".
Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.
Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part.
), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, so she can lead the ensemble.
Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.
Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras.
In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a video camera pointed at the principal conductor and a closed-circuit TV set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.
The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section.
The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th-century works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including Gustav Holst's ''The Planets'', and Richard Strauss's ''Ein Heldenleben''.
4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No.
There are a range of different employment arrangements.
Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet ''Swan Lake'', Claude Debussy's ''La Mer'', and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz.
In the Baroque music era (1600-1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue.
In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section).
The most sought-after positions are permanent, tenured positions in the orchestra.
The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.
During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below.
To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.
''Gruppen'' was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez.
The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster.
Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre.
The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.
Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more.
These advances would lead Hector Berlioz to write a landmark book on instrumentation, which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.
Some modern orchestras also do without conductors, particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called "period") performances of baroque and earlier music.
Saxophones, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores.
The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' and several other works by Strauss, Béla Bartók, and others; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No.
The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and/or voices.
As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be "fixed" by audio editing or overdubbing.
The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue.
As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra’s concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.
This brought about a revolution in orchestral composition, and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years.
Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire, such as the symphonies of Johannes Brahms.
In April 1996, the orchestra’s press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of maternity leave would be a problem.
Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth.
The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the string section, since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).
In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''Westdeutscher Rundfunk'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity () that this organism currently has".
A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the Sixth, also known as the ''Pastoral Symphony''.
Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being typically made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.
Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a concerto, a solo Bach movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare).
* Non-musical instruments such as a typewriter or reel-to-reel tape player
During concertos, the orchestra plays an accompaniment role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing.
Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of contemporary classical music, instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add electric instruments such as electric guitar, electronic instruments such as synthesizers, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).
One example in the late century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Gruppen'', for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience.
However, orchestras are used sometimes in popular music (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in film music, and increasingly often in video game music.
Orchestras also play during operas, ballets, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works).
The techniques of polystylism and polytempo music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.
The primary duties of the conductor are to set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.
Historically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians.
Typically, this would be a harpsichord player, a pipe organist or a luteist or theorbo player.
During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the symphonic poem, a form devised by Franz Liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures.
A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a "sub".
Conductors act as guides to the orchestras and/or choirs they conduct.
In the 20th century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly-developed electric and electronic instruments in various combinations.
The first is a Baroque orchestra (i.e., J.S.
In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers.
The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler.
Examples include the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra.
The term "orchestra" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of big-band music.
One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or she may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time.
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras.
Music administrators such as Michael Tilson Thomas and Esa-Pekka Salonen argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra.
The influence of Gustav Mahler was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth Symphony No.&nbsp;8, Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces.
The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner.
There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.
The third horn in the "Eroica" Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of "choral" brass in the Trio movement.
* Other electronic musical instruments
4, which each specify a single flute.
The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or "leader" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the conductor.
The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on her interpretation of the music being performed.
Apart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.
Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in").
A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of ‘blind’ auditions, where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."
This way, the "sound masses" could be spacialized, as in an electroacoustic work.
A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.
Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts.
The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians).
They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media.
These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.
In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period.
The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution.
A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a ritard during a cadence or ending.
The conductor uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.
Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments.
The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the "Eroica" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded.
A full-size orchestra may sometimes be called a ''symphony orchestra'' or ''philharmonic orchestra''.
While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.
As the early 20th&nbsp;century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works.
In Western nations, some ensembles, such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster).
All members of a professional orchestra must audition for positions in the ensemble.
While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' and Sergei Rachmaninoff's ''Symphonic Dances'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''Boléro'', Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2, Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's ''Belshazzar's Feast'', and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble.

Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part.
The most frequently performed repertoire for a symphony orchestra is Western classical music or opera.
In some works which combined choirs and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers.
As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and sound effect such as the wind machine.
Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work ''On Conducting''.
Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion.
In modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a conductor, although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the concertmaster or the harpsichordist playing the continuo.
Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral "palette" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect.
U.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra (in April 2011), and the Louisville Orchestra, in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 2006, the Honolulu Orchestra in March 2011, the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra in April 2011, and the Syracuse Symphony in June 2011.

With this history in mind, the orchestra can be analyzed in five periods: the Baroque era, the Classical music period, early/mid-Romantic music era, late-Romantic/early 20th century music and 21st century era.
The symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal Marxist state, in which all people are equal.
The most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates.
Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to ''Das Rheingold'' calls for six harps.
The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience.
The orchestral repertoire also includes a range of other pieces, such as Baroque dance suites, symphonic dances and suites of film or ballet music.

The composer's instrumentation almost always included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets.
The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.
Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.
The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.
The so-called "standard complement" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by Beethoven.

The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from Richard Wagner's Bayreuth orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas.
In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and Ludwig van Beethoven's influence on the classical model.
Orchestras also perform overtures, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.
Every instrumental group (or section) has a '''principal''' who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos.
To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor.
In 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-revolutionary Soviet Union.

Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the concertmaster, the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members.
As well, as part of the early music movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing basso continuo performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.
Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists in concertos.
Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply "getting through" the music as best as possible was the standard.
The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an accompaniment part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins.
Bach, Handel, Vivaldi), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the basso continuo group (e.g., harpsichord or pipe organ and assorted bass instruments to perform the bassline), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early Beethoven along with Mozart and Haydn), which used a smaller group of performers than a Romantic music orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th century orchestra (e.g., Wagner, Brahms, Mahler, Stravinsky), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., Adams, Barber, Aaron Copland, Glass, Penderecki).
As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a committee, which determined tempos and playing styles.
These performers are not typically permanent orchestra members.
For several decades after his death, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.
Unless these instruments are played by members "doubling" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to contrabassoon for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire freelance musicians to augment their regular ensemble.
The typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related musical instruments called the woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings (violin, viola, cello and double bass).
In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.

They are typically freelancers hired on contract for one or more concerts.
Also, while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles.
''Chamber orchestra'' usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that.
Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets and some types of musical theater (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas).
Along with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances.
