Further use of the words ''laser'' and ''maser'' in an extended sense, not referring to laser technology or devices, can be seen in usages such as ''astrophysical maser'' and ''atom laser''.
That provoked a twenty-eight-year lawsuit, featuring scientific prestige and money as the stakes.
* Military: Marking targets, guiding munitions, missile defense, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), alternative to radar, blinding troops.
The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some electrons into higher-energy ("excited") quantum states.
Excimer lasers are a special sort of gas laser powered by an electric discharge in which the lasing medium is an excimer, or more precisely an exciplex in existing designs.
A laser that produces light by itself is technically an optical oscillator rather than an optical amplifier as suggested by the acronym.
In addition, the fiber's waveguiding properties tend to reduce thermal distortion of the beam.
Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov were independently working on the quantum oscillator and solved the problem of continuous-output systems by using more than two energy levels.
Today, it is accepted that even low-power lasers with only a few milliwatts of output power can be hazardous to human eyesight when the beam hits the eye directly or after reflection from a shiny surface.
Many industrial and scientific lasers are in this class.
Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is enhanced beyond that due to spontaneous emission.
However, all such devices are classified as "lasers" based on their method of producing light, i.e., stimulated emission.
VECSELs are external-cavity VCSELs.
This effect is called photodarkening.
In 1955, Prokhorov and Basov suggested optical pumping of a multi-level system as a method for obtaining the population inversion, later a main method of laser pumping.
Laser weapons capable of directly damaging or destroying a target in combat are still in the experimental stage.
These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.
A transition from the higher to a lower energy state, however, produces an additional photon; this is the process of '''stimulated emission'''.
Ultimately, the project was deemed to be infeasible, and was cancelled in December 2011, with the Boeing YAL-1 prototype being stored and eventually dismantled.
Lasers used by hobbyists are generally of class IIIa or IIIb (see Safety), although some have made their own class IV types.
Guiding of light allows extremely long gain regions providing good cooling conditions; fibers have high surface area to volume ratio which allows efficient cooling.
Such devices would be one-shot weapons.
Due to the Fourier limit (also known as energy-time uncertainty), a pulse of such short temporal length has a spectrum spread over a considerable bandwidth.
Most laser diodes used in communication systems fall in that category.

Although these tunable lasers are mainly known in their liquid form, researchers have also demonstrated narrow-linewidth tunable emission in dispersive oscillator configurations incorporating solid-state dye gain media.
On the other hand, the light from a semiconductor laser typically exits the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50Â°.
This is a quantum phenomenon discovered by Einstein who derived the relationship between the A coefficient describing spontaneous emission and the B coefficient which applies to absorption and stimulated emission.
These lasers are also commonly frequency doubled, tripled or quadrupled to produce 532&nbsp;nm (green, visible), 355&nbsp;nm and 266&nbsp;nm (UV) beams, respectively.
*Class 1 is inherently safe, usually because the light is contained in an enclosure, for example in CD players.

The Ho-YAG is usually operated in a pulsed mode, and passed through optical fiber surgical devices to resurface joints, remove rot from teeth, vaporize cancers, and pulverize kidney and gall stones.
Due to the cost of lasers, some hobbyists use inexpensive means to obtain lasers, such as salvaging laser diodes from broken DVD players (red), Blu-ray players (violet), or even higher power laser diodes from CD or DVD burners.

VCSEL devices typically have a more circular output beam than conventional laser diodes.
The U.S. Patent Office denied his application, and awarded a patent to Bell Labs, in 1960.
Furthermore, nonlinearity of the oscillating cloud would produce both spatial and temporal harmonics, so nuclear transitions of higher multipolarity could also be driven at multiples of the laser frequency.
Such a laser is known as ''continuous wave'' (''CW'').
Lasing without maintaining the medium excited into a population inversion  was discovered in 1992 in sodium gas and again in 1995 in rubidium gas by various international teams.
A mode-locked laser is capable of emitting extremely short pulses on the order of tens of picoseconds down to less than 10 femtoseconds.
The molecular fluorine laser,  emitting at 157&nbsp;nm in the vacuum ultraviolet is sometimes referred to as an excimer laser, however this appears to be a misnomer inasmuch as F2 is a stable compound.
The wide gain spectrum of available dyes, or mixtures of dyes, allows these lasers to be highly tunable, or to produce very short-duration pulses (on the order of a few femtoseconds).
(However the term is not applied to mode-locked lasers, where the ''intention'' is to create very short pulses at the rate of the round-trip time).
However, compared to other hobbyists, laser hobbyists are far less common, due to the cost and potential dangers involved.
The phase associated with the photon that is emitted is random.
Space-based X-ray lasers pumped by a nuclear explosion have also been proposed as antimissile weapons.

In March 2009, Northrop Grumman claimed that its engineers in Redondo Beach had successfully built and tested an electrically powered solid state laser capable of producing a 100-kilowatt beam, powerful enough to destroy an airplane.
In some other lasers it would require pumping the laser at a very high continuous power level which would be impractical or destroy the laser by producing excessive heat.
When an electron absorbs energy either from light (photons) or heat (phonons), it receives that incident quantum of energy.
Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons.
:''For a more complete list of laser types see this list of laser types.''
These gain media could release stimulated emissions between an excited state and a lower excited state, not the ground state, facilitating the maintenance of a population inversion.
Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state.
It has been shown that unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce fractal shaped beams.
While FEL beams share the same optical traits as other lasers, such as coherent radiation, FEL operation is quite different.
A laser consists of a gain medium, a mechanism to energize it, and something to provide optical feedback.
In 1950, Alfred Kastler (Nobel Prize for Physics 1966) proposed the method of optical pumping, experimentally confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.
The gain medium of a laser is normally a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam by the process of stimulated emission described above.
As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency.
Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond.
When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called "spontaneous emission".
When the modulation rate is on time scales much slower than the cavity lifetime and the time period over which energy can be stored in the lasing medium or pumping mechanism, then it is still classified as a "modulated" or "pulsed" continuous wave laser.
This drastically reduces the population of the lower energy state thus greatly facilitating a population inversion.
In the case of extremely short pulses, that implies lasing over a considerable bandwidth, quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of CW lasers.
When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution looking for a problem".

Lasers that produce pulses can also be characterized based on the ''peak'' power of each pulse.
Recent technology has allowed prototypes for laser communications and visible light communication in outer space.
Again, because of the extremely short pulse duration, such a laser will produce pulses which achieve an extremely high peak power.
Pulsed operation of lasers refers to any laser not classified as continuous wave, so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some repetition rate.

Gould's linguistic intention was using the "-aser" word particle as a suffix â to accurately denote the spectrum of the light emitted by the LASER device; thus x-rays: ''xaser'', ultraviolet: ''uvaser'', et cetera; none established itself as a discrete term, although "raser" was briefly popular for denoting radio-frequency-emitting devices.
Among their many applications, lasers are used in optical disk drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners; DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic and free-space optical communication; laser surgery and skin treatments; cutting and welding materials; military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed; and laser lighting displays in entertainment.

At a conference in 1959, Gordon Gould published the term LASER in the paper ''The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation''.
Such a transition to the higher state is called absorption, and it destroys an incident photon (the photon's energy goes into powering the increased energy of the higher state).
The communication range of free-space optical communication is currently of the order of several thousand kilometers, but has the potential to bridge interplanetary distances of millions of kilometers, using optical telescopes as beam expanders.
An example of a suitable material is titanium-doped, artificially grown sapphire (Ti:sapphire) which has a very wide gain bandwidth and can thus produce pulses of only a few femtoseconds duration.

In a continuous wave (CW) laser, the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser.
Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated.
There are some lasers that are not single spatial mode and consequently have light beams that diverge more than is required by the diffraction limit.
Solid-state lasers or laser amplifiers where the light is guided due to the total internal reflection in a single mode optical fiber are instead called fiber lasers.
Fiber lasers have a fundamental limit in that the intensity of the light in the fiber cannot be so high that optical nonlinearities induced by the local electric field strength can become dominant and prevent laser operation and/or lead to the material destruction of the fiber.
For pulsed lasers and invisible wavelengths, other power limits apply.
