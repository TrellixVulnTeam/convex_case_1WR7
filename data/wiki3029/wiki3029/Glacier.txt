Glacier is moving down valley, then spreading out on plain.
Crevasses can form in several different ways.
A radar instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found ice under a thin layer of rocks in formations called lobate debris aprons (LDAs).
This creates a swale and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in turn creates a ridge.
Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally.
These surges may be caused by failure of the underlying bedrock, the pooling of meltwater at the base of the glacier&nbsp;&mdash; perhaps delivered from a supraglacial lake&nbsp;&mdash; or the simple accumulation of mass beyond a critical "tipping point".
Others are produced by fans or deltas created by meltwater.
The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to Rayleigh scattering due to bubbles in the ice.
They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines.
In alpine glaciers, friction is also generated at the valley's side walls, which slows the edges relative to the center.
The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation zone.
This expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it.

Glaciers also move through basal sliding.

* ''Glacial till'': material directly deposited from glacial ice.
An alpine glacier that fills a valley is sometimes called a ''valley glacier''.
A ''cold-based glacier'' is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate.
Some kames form when meltwater deposits sediments through openings in the interior of the ice.
Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface.
Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs.
Mountain glaciers are widespread, especially in the Andes, the Himalayas, the Rocky Mountains, the Caucasus, and the Alps.
Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.
The pressure on ice deeper than 50&nbsp;m causes plastic flow.
The corresponding area of study is called glaciology.
Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow.
The south polar cap is especially comparable to glaciers on Earth.
* Shape, abundance and hardness of rock fragments contained in the ice at the bottom of the glacier
This structure may result in a mountain pass.
A few glaciers have periods of very rapid advancement called surges.
Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.
On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia, and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands.
Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant.
The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of slope on the land, amount of snowfall and the winds.
In addition to the dry, unglaciated polar regions, some mountains and volcanoes in Bolivia, Chile and Argentina are high () and cold, but the relative lack of precipitation prevents snow from accumulating into glaciers.
Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater.
Eskers are composed of sand and gravel that was deposited by meltwater streams that flowed through ice tunnels within or beneath a glacier.
Most are circular in shape because the blocks of ice that formed them were rounded as they melted.
Material that becomes incorporated in a glacier is typically carried as far as the zone of ablation before being deposited.
Some rock formations in the path of a glacier are sculpted into small hills called ''roche moutonnée,'' or "sheepback" rock.
Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces.
The snowpack also never reaches melting point.
When the deposition is in an estuary, the sediments are known as bay mud.
Picture taken with HiRISE under the HiWish program.
The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass.
This process, called plucking, is caused by subglacial water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands.
Less apparent are ground moraines, also called ''glacial drift'', which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line.
This picture shows several glaciers that have the same shape as many features on Mars that are believed to also be glaciers.
In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves.
Ogives are formed when ice from an icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer.
Kettle diameters range from 5&nbsp;m to 13&nbsp;km, with depths of up to 45&nbsp;meters.
Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.
A ''sub-polar glacier'' includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier.
Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.
The speed of glacial displacement is partly determined by friction.
The pulverized rock this process produces is called rock flour and is made up of rock grains  between 0.002 and 0.00625&nbsp;mm in size.
Glaciers move, or flow, downhill due to gravity and the internal deformation of ice.
Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.
Patterns of glacial erratics hint at past glacial motions.
Image:Glacier as seen by ctx.JPG|Mesa in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle, as seen by CTX.
This zone is where meltwater refreezes as a cold layer in the glacier, forming a continuous mass of ice.
The polar ice caps of Mars show geologic evidence of glacial deposits.
Areas of the Arctic, such as Banks Island, and the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are considered polar deserts where glaciers cannot form because they receive little snowfall despite the bitter cold.
Dilation faulting can be observed in recently de-glaciated parts of Iceland and Cumbria.
The top  of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure.
These glaciers exhibit normal movement until suddenly they accelerate, then return to their previous state.
Till includes a mixture of undifferentiated material ranging from clay size to boulders, the usual composition of a moraine.
On Earth the ridge would be called the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier.
Even at high latitudes, glacier formation is not inevitable.
Location is in Protonilus Mensae in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle.
Glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries, excluding those (Australia, South Africa) that have glaciers only on distant subantarctic island territories.
During glacial periods of the Quaternary, Taiwan, Hawaii on Mauna Kea and Tenerife also had large alpine glaciers, while the Faroe and Crozet Islands were completely glaciated.
* Thickness of the ice
Large masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the Earth into the mantle.
Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features.
When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone.
During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed.
One of the glaciers is seen in greater detail in the next two images from HiRISE.
Many glaciers deepen their valleys more than their smaller tributaries.
Roche moutonnée have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides.
As the speed of the water decreases, so does its capacity to carry objects in suspension.
Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran.
The accumulation zone can be subdivided based on its melt conditions.
After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions known as cirques.
Glacial bodies larger than  are called ''ice sheets'' or ''continental glaciers''.
This zone is often marked by refrozen ice lenses, glands, and layers.
Basal sliding is dominant in temperate, or warm-based glaciers.
Below the equilibrium line, glacial meltwater is concentrated in stream channels.
Because glacial mass is affected by long-term climactic changes, e.g., precipitation, mean temperature, and cloud cover, glacial mass changes are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change and are a major source of variations in sea level.
Mainland Australia currently contains no glaciers, although a small glacier on Mount Kosciuszko was present in the last glacial period.
It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.
Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of fresh water on Earth.
The water thus gradually deposits the sediment as it runs, creating an alluvial plain.
Their heights vary from 15 to 50&nbsp;meters and they can reach a kilometer in length.
Meltwater can pool in proglacial lakes on top of a glacier or descend into the depths of a glacier via moulins.
Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate.
The word ''Glaceon'' is a loanword from French and goes back, via Franco-Provençal, to the Vulgar Latin '''', derived from the Late Latin '''', and ultimately Latin '''', meaning "ice".
Healthy glaciers have large accumulation zones, more than 60% of their area snowcovered at the end of the melt season, and a terminus with vigorous flow.
Drumlins are found in groups called ''drumlin fields'' or ''drumlin camps''.
On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.
Evidence for flow comes from the many lines on surface.
Cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier.
They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier.
Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as ''polythermal''.
Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation.
In this process, a glacier slides over the terrain on which it sits, lubricated by the presence of liquid water.
There may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of Alaska, trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits.
Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ''ice streams''.
Glacial moraines are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated.
In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year, glacial earthquakes occur.
Larger pieces of rock that are encrusted in till or deposited on the surface are called "glacial erratics".
The water is created from ice that melts under high pressure from frictional heating.

They range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long.
At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers.
This leads to an effect similar to what would be seen if the rock were hit by a large hammer.
Very fine glacial sediments or rock flour is often picked up by wind blowing over the bare surface and may be deposited great distances from the original fluvial deposition site.
Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier.
Sometimes ogives consist only of undulations or color bands and are described as wave ogives or band ogives.
If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening  a crevasse.
Crevasses are seldom more than  deep but in some cases can be  or even deeper.
Velocity increases with increasing slope, increasing thickness, increasing snowfall, increasing longitudinal confinement, increasing basal temperature, increasing meltwater production and reduced bed hardness.
Drumlins are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made mainly of till.
If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed pyramidal peaks; particularly steep examples are called horns.
* Velocity of glacial movement
# The wet snow zone is the region where all of the snow deposited since the end of the previous summer has been raised to 0&nbsp;°C.
Friction makes the ice at the bottom of the glacier move more slowly than ice at the top.
Continental glaciers cover nearly  or about 98 percent of Antarctica's , with an average thickness of .
Following the Little Ice Age's end around 1850, glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially.
Image from Ismenius Lacus quadrangle.
These deposits are stratified by size.
This is because these peaks are located near or in the hyperarid Atacama Desert.
A '''glacier''' ( or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries.
Glacial abrasion is commonly characterized by glacial striations.
The erosion that creates glacial valleys eliminates the spurs of earth that extend across mountain valleys, creating triangular cliffs called truncated spurs.
''Tidewater glaciers'' are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields.
* Thermal conditions at the glacier base
The term ''moraine'' is of French origin.
Extensive glaciers are found in Antarctica, Chile, Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Iceland.
They usually appear as linear mounds of till, a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material.
* Permeability and water pressure at the glacier base
Africa has glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, on Mount Kenya and in the Rwenzori Mountains.
Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.
Abrasion leads to steeper valley walls and mountain slopes in alpine settings, which can cause avalanches and rock slides, which add even more material to the glacier.
Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load.
The process of glacier establishment, growth and flow is called glaciation.
When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.
In New Guinea, small, rapidly diminishing, glaciers are located on its highest summit massif of Puncak Jaya.
Glacial deposits are of two distinct types:
The next three images from Mars show shapes similar to the Elephant Foot Glacier.
If a glacial valley runs into a large body of water, it forms a fjord.
Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an arête is left.
The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland.
The rate of glacier erosion varies.
Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called paternoster lakes.
When a glacier's size shrinks below a critical point, its flow stops and it becomes stationary.
In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60–70% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs.
The health of a glacier is usually assessed by determining the glacier mass balance or observing terminus behavior.
* ''Fluvial and outwash sediments'': sediments deposited by water.
A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950–1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.
Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50&nbsp;m (160&nbsp;ft).
The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along, but tears loose and carries away rock from the downstream side via plucking.
Glacial ice has a distinctive blue tint because it absorbs some red light due to an overtone of the infrared OH stretching mode of the water molecule.
At the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque, which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley.
''Alpine glaciers'', also known as ''mountain glaciers'' or ''cirque glaciers'', form on the crests and slopes of mountains.
A large body of glacial ice astride a mountain, mountain range, or volcano is termed an  ''ice cap'' or ''ice field''.
The area in which a glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm) - a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes) - which collects and compresses through gravity the snow which falls into it.
Area in rectangle is enlarged in the next photo.
The steepest side of the hill faces the direction from which the ice advanced (''stoss''), while a longer slope is left in the ice's direction of movement (''lee'').
Long, sinuous glacial deposits are called ''eskers''.
Glaciers are categorized  by their morphology, thermal characteristics, and behavior.
Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund.
This upper section is known as the ''fracture zone'' and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section.
''Ogives'' are alternating wave crests and valleys that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces.
Topographical features and computer models indicate the existence of more glaciers in Mars' past.
This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it forming névé.
The pictures below illustrate how landscape features on Mars closely resemble those on the Earth.
Crevasses make travel over glaciers hazardous, especially when they are hidden by fragile snow bridges.
A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, appears blue as large quantities of water appear blue.
Image:Wide view of glacier showing image field.JPG|Glacier as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program.
Glacial deposits that take the shape of hills or mounds are called ''kames''.
Even during glacial periods of the Quaternary, Manchuria, lowland Siberia, and central and northern Alaska, though extraordinarily cold, had such light snowfall that glaciers could not form.
# The percolation zone is an area with some surface melt, causing meltwater to percolate into the snowpack.
The depression usually totals a third of the ice sheet or glacier's thickness.
Glaciers are important components of the global cryosphere.
As on Earth, many glaciers are covered with a layer of rocks which insulates the ice.
Between 19˚N and 19˚S, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above  usually have permanent snow.
In other cases, glaciers can move as fast as  per day, such as in Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbræ ().
Abrasion occurs when the ice and its load of rock fragments slide over bedrock and function as sandpaper, smoothing and polishing the bedrock below.
Under the pressure of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser firn.
Oceanic islands with glaciers occur on Iceland, Svalbard, New Zealand, Jan Mayen and the subantarctic islands of Marion, Heard, Grande Terre (Kerguelen) and Bouvet.
When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.
It was coined by peasants to describe alluvial embankments and rims found near the margins of glaciers in the French Alps.
* Relative ease of erosion of the surface under the glacier
This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue.
In a study using data from January 1993 through October 2005, more events were detected every year since 2002, and  twice as many events were recorded in 2005 as there were in any other year.
In modern geology, the term is used more broadly, and is applied to a series of formations, all of which are composed of till.
These tunnels sometimes reemerge at the glacier's surface.
When this phenomenon occurs in a valley, it is called a ''valley train''.
Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock.
