Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true ''Q'', therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output.
Cardiac Index, measured in l/min/m², is defined as
2D measurement of the diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV).
The availability of a continuous, high-fidelity, calibrated blood pressure waveform opened up the perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called characteristic impedance.
Disadvantages include its inability to provide data regarding right-sided heart pressures or mixed venous oxygen saturation.
A more detailed hierarchical illustration is provided in a subsequent figure.
Along with stroke volume (SV), cardiac output is a global blood flow parameter of interest in hæmodynamics – the study of the flow of blood under external forces.
They require an arterial line and are therefore invasive.
By synchronizing fluid volume changes with the heartbeat, the change in impedance can be used to calculate stroke volume, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.
The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output.
This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in—even when it was not designed for it—because it applied general physiological principles.

This shift can then be used to calculate flow velocity and volume, and effectively cardiac output, using the following equations:
Changes in vascular function, the position of the catheter tip or damping of the pressure waveform signal will affect the accuracy of the readings.
Like PiCCO, frequent calibration is recommended when there is a change in Q. Calibration events are limited in frequency because they involve the injection of lithium chloride and can be subject to errors in the presence of certain muscle relaxants.
The Fick principle, first described by Adolf Eugen Fick in 1870, assumes the rate of oxygen consumption is a function of the rate of blood flow and the rate of oxygen picked up by the red blood cells.
