Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.
The Jacobian also occurs in the inverse function theorem.
Expressed in terms of the entries of ''A'', these are
It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently.
Thus, for complex matrices ,
In particular, if ''A'' is invertible, we have

# Viewing an  matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.
Properties 1, 7 and 9 — which all follow from the Leibniz formula — completely characterize the determinant; in other words the determinant is the unique function from  matrices to scalars that is ''n''-linear alternating in the columns, and takes the value 1 for the identity matrix (this characterization holds even if scalars are taken in any given commutative ring).
It can be viewed as the scaling factor of the transformation described by the matrix.
Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g.
In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.

The absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram.
It is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range  occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation.
Sylvester's criterion asserts that this is equivalent to the determinants of the submatrices

See the Wronskian and linear independence.
Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero bilinear form with a regular element of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative).
The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the main diagonal: .
(''n'' factorial) for an  matrix ''M''.
For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated.
This fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function  satisfies
More generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation (if ''A'' is an orthogonal  or  matrix, this is a rotation), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.
The Fredholm determinant defines the determinant for operators known as trace class operators by an appropriate generalization of the formula
If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of analytic functions, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent.

The study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory.
To show that  is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors  and  representing the parallelogram's sides.
Nonetheless, explicitly calculating determinants is required in some situations, and different methods are available to do so.
It has recently been shown that Cramer's rule can be implemented in O(''n''3) time, which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations, such as LU, QR, or singular value decomposition.

This is a consequence of properties 7 and 9 in the following way: by property&nbsp;7 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;9.
Another way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.
We call this scalar the determinant of ''T''.
For example, the determinant of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using modular arithmetic).
Such expressions are deducible from combinatorial arguments, Newton's identities, or the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm.
Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities.

Thus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''.
The determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its rank equals the size of the matrix.
For this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power Λ''n''(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as vector bundles or chain complexes of vector spaces.
Since the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions?
When the entries of the matrix are taken from a field (like the real or complex numbers), it can be proven that any matrix has a unique inverse if and only if its determinant is nonzero.
The next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of  reduces to the multiplication theorem.

Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of algebraic groups, from the general linear group to the multiplicative group,
This follows from properties 7 and 9 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps).
As mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent.
terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of  matrices and  matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.

To each linear transformation ''T'' on ''V'' we associate a linear transformation ''T''′ on ''W'', where for each ''w'' in ''W'' we define .
This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function  that maps  can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity.
It is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''−1 are linearly independent.

Various other theorems can be proved as well, including that the determinant of a product of matrices is always equal to the product of determinants; and, the determinant of a Hermitian matrix is always real.
For example, a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations, and the determinant can be used to solve those equations, although more efficient techniques are actually used, some of which are determinant-revealing and consist of computationally effective ways of computing the determinant itself.
The immanant generalizes both by introducing a character of the symmetric group S''n'' in Leibniz's rule.
This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above.
Yet another equivalent formulation is
Functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.
The oriented area is the same as the usual area, except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix).
The product of all non-zero eigenvalues is referred to as pseudo-determinant.

The formula can be expressed in terms of the complete exponential Bell polynomial of ''n'' arguments ''s''''l'' = - (''l'' – 1)!
This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an  matrix contributes ''n''!
Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a unitriangular matrix and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to
For example, here is the result for a 4 × 4 matrix:
These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.

It was Vandermonde (1771) who first recognized determinants as independent functions.
These inequalities can be proved by bringing the matrix ''A'' to the diagonal form.
where ω''j'' is an ''n''th root of 1.
A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other ways to define the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, for instance the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix.
For each permutation σ, sgn(σ) denotes the signature of σ, a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by σ can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and −1 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.
Secondly, given a ring homomorphism , there is a map  given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''.
The absolute value of  is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''.
The rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic for the  matrix determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration.
can be computed using the following matrices:
Lewis Carroll of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland fame) invented a method for computing determinants called Dodgson condensation.

For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in '''R'''''n'' represents an orthonormal basis in Euclidean space.
This definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition.
By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''''i'' (equivalently each column as '''C'''''i'') and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''''j'' and '''R'''''k'' (or '''C'''''j'' and '''C'''''k''), where ''j'',''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an  square matrix.
The determinant defines a mapping
This means that whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, or more generally some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e.
When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is equi-areal and orientation-preserving.
Conversely, determinants can be used to find the eigenvalues of the matrix : they are the solutions of the characteristic equation
The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at , , , and , as shown in the accompanying diagram.
This means, for example, that an O(''n''2.376) algorithm exists based on the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm.
Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a group homomorphism.
being positive, for all  between 1 and .
While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear.
These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;8) or else ±1 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;11 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol.
