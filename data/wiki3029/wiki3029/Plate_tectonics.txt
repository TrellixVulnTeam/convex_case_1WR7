This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle.
This was described in the crucial paper of Bruce Heezen (1960), which would trigger a real revolution in thinking.
Modern theories that continue building on the older mantle doming concepts and see plate movements as a secondary phenomena are beyond the scope of this page and are discussed elsewhere (for example on the plume tectonics page).
It is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature.
For example, the African Plate includes the continent and parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
Later studies (discussed below on this page), therefore, invoked many of the relationships recognized during this pre-plate tectonics period to support their theories (see the anticipations and reviews in the work of van Dijk and collaborators).
Specifically, they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust.
Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces) and drag, with downward suction, at the subduction zones.
The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone.
For much of the last quarter century, the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale convection currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere.
The manifestation of this varying lateral density is mantle convection from buoyancy forces.
The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of  and broke up about .
It has generally been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere.
As the ocean plate splits, the ridge forms at the spreading center, the ocean basin expands, and finally, the plate area increases causing many small volcanoes and/or shallow earthquakes.
The two types of crust also differ in thickness, with continental crust being considerably thicker than oceanic (35&nbsp;km vs. 6&nbsp;km).
These ideas, which find their roots in the early 1930s with the so-called "fixistic" ideas of the European and Russian Earth Science Schools, find resonance in the modern theories which envisage hot spots/mantle plumes which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates over time and leave their traces in the geological record (though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms, but rather as modulators).
This division should not be confused with the ''chemical'' subdivision of these same layers into the mantle (comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its temperature and pressure.
However, his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists, who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift.
The Pacific plate, for instance, is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction (the so-called Ring of Fire) and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin, which are attached (perhaps one could say 'welded') to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates.
During the 20th century, improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as seismographs enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas, most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges.
# ''Plate boundary zones'' occur where the effects of the interactions are unclear, and the boundaries, usually occurring along a broad belt, are not well defined and may show various types of movements in different episodes.
Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements ("mafic") than continental crust ("felsic").
Average oceanic lithosphere is typically  thick; its thickness is a function of its age: as time passes, it conductively cools and subjacent cooling mantle is added to its base.
# ''Transform boundaries (Conservative)'' occur where two lithospheric plates slide, or perhaps more accurately, grind past each other along transform faults, where plates are neither created nor destroyed.
So, still the question remained: how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth?
Continental lithosphere is typically ~200&nbsp;km thick, though this varies considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable cratonic interiors of continents.
The location where two plates meet is called a ''plate boundary''.
Those calculations had implied that, even if it started at red heat, the Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years.
Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones, and the basins that develop along the active boundary are often called "foreland basins".
However, this was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of the Earth.
In line with other previous and contemporaneous proposals, in 1912 the meteorologist Alfred Wegener amply described what he called continental drift, expanded in his 1915 book ''The Origin of Continents and Oceans'' and the scientific debate started that would end up fifty years later in the theory of plate tectonics.
Active zones of Mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise), and continent-to-continent rifting (such as Africa's East African Rift and Valley, Red Sea) are examples of divergent boundaries.
As old oceanic crust is "consumed" in the trenches (like Holmes and others, he thought this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere, not, as now understood, by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle), new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust.
As explained above, tectonic plates may include continental crust or oceanic crust, and most plates contain both.
Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches.
However, some researchers remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet.
Tectonic lithosphere plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by either or both of two types of crustal material: oceanic crust (in older texts called ''sima'' from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (''sial'' from silicon and aluminium).
The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation.
Therefore, when various scientists during the early sixties started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor, the pieces of the theory quickly fell into place.
Dietz and Hess (the former published the same idea one year earlier in ''Nature'', but priority belongs to Hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article by 1960) were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the, at that time, unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like Holmes.
The question particularly intrigued Harry Hammond Hess, a Princeton University geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral, and Robert S. Dietz, a scientist with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey who first coined the term ''seafloor spreading''.
A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was, and still is, being continually created along the oceanic ridges.
As a result of this density stratification, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the Pacific Plate), while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level (see the page isostasy for explanation of this principle).
In reality, it actually shows that the work by the European scientists on island arcs and mountain belts performed and published during the 1930s up until the 1950s was applied and appreciated also in the United States.
However, their data fail a "magnetic reversal test", which is used to see if they were formed by flipping polarities of a global magnetic field.
The Himalayas, the world's tallest mountain range, are assumed to have been formed by the collision of two major plates.
Reasoning in an opposite way, the continents might have shifted and rotated, while the pole remained relatively fixed.
All this evidence, both from the ocean floor and from the continental margins, made it clear around 1965 that continental drift was feasible and the theory of plate tectonics, which was defined in a series of papers between 1965 and 1967, was born, with all its extraordinary explanatory and predictive power.
# the stripes are symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean ridges; at or near the crest of the ridge, the rocks are very young, and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest;
In the early 1960s scientists such as Heezen, Hess and Dietz had begun to theorise that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest (see the previous paragraph).
At zones of ocean-to-continent subduction (e.g.
Two- and three-dimensional imaging of Earth's interior (seismic tomography) shows a varying lateral density distribution throughout the mantle.
The same holds for the African, Eurasian, and Antarctic plates.
By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40–60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth.
Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.
These boundaries are discussed in further detail below.
along the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin.
Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the Jurassic period.
However, as the North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, yet it is in motion presents a problem.
How mantle convection directly and indirectly relates to plate motion is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics.
The first time the evidence of magnetic polar wander was used to support the movements of continents was in a paper by Keith Runcorn in 1956, and successive papers by him and his students Ted Irving (who was actually the first to be convinced of the fact that paleomagnetism supported continental drift) and Ken Creer.
The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement.
Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking.
This theory, called "surge tectonics", became quite popular in geophysics and geodynamics during the 1980s and 1990s.
Starting from the idea (also expressed by his forerunners) that the present continents once formed a single land mass (which was called Pangea later on) that drifted apart, thus releasing the continents from the Earth's mantle and likening them to "icebergs" of low density granite floating on a sea of denser basalt.
His paper, though little noted (and even ridiculed) at the time, has since been called "seminal" and "prescient".
When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded the Earth's magnetic field at the time.
In particular, the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea, and in 1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force.
Beginning in the 1950s, scientists like Victor Vacquier, using magnetic instruments (magnetometers) adapted from airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines, began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor.
Ironically, these systematic relations studies in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century underline exactly the opposite: that the plates had not moved in time, that the deformation grid was fixed with respect to the Earth equator and axis, and that gravitational driving forces were generally acting vertically and caused only local horizontal movements (the so-called pre-plate tectonic, "fixist theories").
Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed.
But without detailed evidence and a force sufficient to drive the movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core, but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around.
Recent research, based on three-dimensional computer modeling, suggests that plate geometry is governed by a feedback between mantle convection patterns and the strength of the lithosphere.
, and by Warren Carey in a symposium held in March 1956.
An alternative explanation, though, was that the continents had moved (shifted and rotated) relative to the north pole, and each continent, in fact, shows its own "polar wander path".
Today, extensive studies are dedicated to the calibration of the normal-reversal patterns in the oceanic crust on one hand and known timescales derived from the dating of basalt layers in sedimentary sequences (magnetostratigraphy) on the other, to arrive at estimates of past spreading rates and plate reconstructions.
Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move, and it may well be that such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water.
This had previously been estimated by its cooling rate and assumption the Earth's surface radiated like a black body.
Lately, the convection theory has been much debated as modern techniques based on 3D seismic tomography still fail to recognize these predicted large scale convection cells.
During the thirties up to the late fifties, works by Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, Umbgrove, and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory.
It therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt (sial) underlies the continental rocks.
It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the driving forces which determine the motion of plates, except for those plates which are not being subducted.
As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns.
Despite much opposition, the view of continental drift gained support and a lively debate started between "drifters" or "mobilists" (proponents of the theory) and "fixists" (opponents).
Current plate boundaries are defined by their seismicity.
the Andes mountain range in South America, and the Cascade Mountains in Western United States), the dense oceanic lithosphere plunges beneath the less dense continent.
As oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material, it gradually cools and thickens with age (and thus adds distance from the ridge).
In this symposium, the evidence was used in the theory of an expansion of the global crust.
Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude.
In this way, the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same.
They demonstrated though that the westward drift, seen only for the past 30&nbsp;Ma, is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate.
One explanation for Venus's lack of plate tectonics is that on Venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be present.
There is debatable evidence of active tectonics in the planet's distant past; however, events taking place since then (such as the plausible and generally accepted hypothesis that the Venusian lithosphere has thickened greatly over the course of several hundred million years) has made constraining the course of its geologic record difficult.
Some scientists interpreted these as requiring plate tectonic processes, such as seafloor spreading.
The geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
In a recent paper, it was suggested that, on the other hand, it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward, and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces).
Strong earthquakes can occur along a fault.
Aleutian islands, Mariana Islands, and the Japanese island arc), older, cooler, denser crust slips beneath less dense crust.
By 1915, after having published a first article in 1912, Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments for the idea of continental drift in the first edition of ''The Origin of Continents and Oceans''.
Furthermore, it was supposed that a static shell of strata was present under the continents.
The driving mechanism behind this movement is described below.
Venus shows no evidence of active plate tectonics.
The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons.
New magma from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust.
Therefore, Heezen advocated the so-called "expanding Earth" hypothesis of S. Warren Carey (see above).
Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well.
Supporting evidence for the idea came from the dove-tailing outlines of South America's east coast and Africa's west coast, and from the matching of the rock formations along these edges.
Another theory is that the mantle flows neither in cells nor large plumes but rather as a series of channels just below the Earth's crust, which then provide basal friction to the lithosphere.
Simultaneous advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around Wadati-Benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins, together with many other geophysical (e.g.
* Some of these ideas were discussed in the context of abandoned fixistic ideas of a deforming globe without continental drift or an expanding Earth.
In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces).
On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water; however, in 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger super-earths with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.
Confirmation of their previous contiguous nature also came from the fossil plants ''Glossopteris'' and ''Gangamopteris'', and the therapsid or mammal-like reptile ''Lystrosaurus'', all widely distributed over South America, Africa, Antarctica, India and Australia.
This theory was launched by Arthur Holmes and some forerunners in the 1930s and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of Alfred Wegener in the early years of the century.
Closure of ocean basins can occur at continent-to-continent boundaries (e.g., Himalayas and Alps): collision between masses of granitic continental lithosphere; neither mass is subducted; plate edges are compressed, folded, uplifted.
The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents.
At zones of ocean-to-ocean subduction (e.g.
In particular, it explains the Gondwanan distribution of ratites and the Antarctic flora.
Therefore, by the mid-1950s, the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on it like an iceberg.
The addition of water lowers the melting point of the mantle material above the subducting slab, causing it to melt.
*Basal drag (friction): Plate motion driven by friction between the convection currents in the asthenosphere and the more rigid overlying lithosphere.
One of the first pieces of geophysical evidence that was used to support the movement of lithospheric plates came from paleomagnetism.
Observations made of the magnetic field of Mars by the ''Mars Global Surveyor'' spacecraft in 1999 showed patterns of magnetic striping discovered on this planet.
By explaining both the zebra-like magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean ridge system, the seafloor spreading hypothesis (SFS) quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics theory.
In the theory of plume tectonics developed during the 1990s, a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used.
Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform.
In the same year, Robert R. Coats of the U.S. Geological Survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the Aleutian Islands.
The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process, arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using Heezen's mechanism of spreading along the ridges.
The discovery of magnetic striping called for an explanation.
Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading.
* At the time, continental drift was not accepted.
As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, the moon's gravity ever so slightly pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward, just as proposed by Alfred Wegener (see above).
Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) propose gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.
The theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift developed during the first few decades of the 20th century.
This can act on various scales, from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire ocean basin.
They are associated with different types of surface phenomena.
The magnetic north and south poles reverse through time, and, especially important in paleotectonic studies, the relative position of the magnetic north pole varies through time.
Wegener was not the first to note this (Abraham Ortelius, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini, Eduard Suess, Roberto Mantovani and Frank Bursley Taylor preceded him just to mention a few), but he was the first to marshal significant fossil and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation (and was supported in this by researchers such as Alex du Toit).
Furthermore, when the rock strata of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way, implying that they were joined initially.
An important conclusion was that along this system, new ocean floor was being created, which led to the concept of the "Great Global Rift".
* They were published during an episode of extreme political and economic instability that hampered scientific communication.
Of the many forces discussed in this paragraph, tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principle driving force of plate tectonics.
At zones of continent-to-continent rifting, divergent boundaries may cause new ocean basin to form as the continent splits, spreads, the central rift collapses, and ocean fills the basin.
At zones of ocean-to-ocean rifting, divergent boundaries form by seafloor spreading, allowing for the formation of new ocean basin.
Slab suction may occur in a geodynamic setting where basal tractions continue to act on the plate as it dives into the mantle (although perhaps to a greater extent acting on both the under and upper side of the slab).
The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the Cretaceous.
Wegener could not explain the force that drove continental drift, and his vindication did not come until after his death in 1930.
There are essentially two main types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion: friction and gravity.
In a more recent 2006 study, scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas.
For these mechanisms to be overall valid, systematic relationships should exist all over the globe between the orientation and kinematics of deformation and the geographical latitudinal and longitudinal grid of the Earth itself.
Certainly there is no evidence that the moon has expanded in the past 3 billion years; other work would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius.
Initially, during the first half of the twentieth century, the latter phenomenon was explained by introducing what was called "polar wander" (see apparent polar wander), i.e., it was assumed that the north pole location had been shifting through time.
Continental drift theory helps biogeographers to explain the disjunct biogeographic distribution of present-day life found on different continents but having similar ancestors.
This hypothesis linked these patterns to geomagnetic reversals and was supported by several lines of evidence:
This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt—the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor—contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings.
Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types, faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of orogenic belts.
In 1947, a team of scientists led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's research vessel ''Atlantis'' and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not the granite which is the main constituent of continents.
More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor.
This was immediately followed by a symposium in Tasmania in March 1956.
Reconstruction is used to establish past (and future) plate configurations, helping determine the shape and make-up of ancient supercontinents and providing a basis for paleogeography.
The San Andreas Fault in California is an example of a transform boundary exhibiting dextral motion.
The debate is still open.
The concept that mountains had "roots" was confirmed by George B. Airy a hundred years later, during study of Himalayan gravitation, and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations.
The much improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.
Three types of plate boundaries exist, with a fourth, mixed type, characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other.
Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust.
It has also been suggested recently in  that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics, as Venus has no moon and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet.
Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time.
Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the Sun and Moon.
In that book (re-issued in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936), he noted how the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa looked as if they were once attached.
Often, these contributions are forgotten because:
This is based on the fact that rocks of different ages show a variable magnetic field direction, evidenced by studies since the mid–nineteenth century.
* Many were published by European scientists and at first not mentioned or given little credit in the papers on sea floor spreading published by the American researchers in the 1960s.
The magma that results typically leads to volcanism.
Somehow, this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move.
The new data that had been collected on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry.
Before uplift, they were covered by the Tethys Ocean.
As it was observed early that although granite existed on continents, seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt, the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust, named "sial" (continental type crust) and "sima" (oceanic type crust).
The result is a slight lateral incline with increased distance from the ridge axis.
This is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat.
The relative motion of the two plates is either sinistral (left side toward the observer) or dextral (right side toward the observer).
Other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include flexural bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate which produces a clear topographical feature that can offset, or at least affect, the influence of topographical ocean ridges, and mantle plumes and hot spots, which are postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates.
Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection.
# ''Divergent boundaries (Constructive)'' occur where two plates slide apart from each other.
Furthermore, paleomagnetic data had shown that the magnetic pole had also shifted during time.
Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming.
And, using the mobilistic concepts developed before, he correctly concluded that many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches – very deep, narrow canyons – are formed, e.g.
If the Earth's crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges, Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them, it must be shrinking elsewhere.
He concluded that tidal forces (the tidal lag or "friction") caused by the Earth's rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon are a driving force for plate tectonics.
The South African Alex du Toit put together a mass of such information in his 1937 publication ''Our Wandering Continents'', and went further than Wegener in recognising the strong links between the Gondwana fragments.
Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, was reported to show tectonic activity in images taken by the ''Huygens'' probe, which landed on Titan on January 14, 2005.
The geometric fit between continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still an important part of plate reconstruction.
The Earth's crust is soaked with water, and water plays an important role in the development of shear zones.
In 1973, George W. Moore of the USGS and R. C. Bostrom presented evidence for a general westward drift of the Earth's lithosphere with respect to the mantle.
Furthermore, the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural "tape recording" of the history of the geomagnetic field reversals (GMFR) of the Earth's magnetic field.
This gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this basically vertically oriented mechanism.
Transform faults occur across a spreading center.
The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate.
All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions.
This process, at first denominated the "conveyer belt hypothesis" and later called seafloor spreading, operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all across the 50,000&nbsp;km-long system of mid-ocean ridges.
