Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly.
Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia.
An area of human chromosome 21 that includes six genes has been linked to frequent oral herpes outbreaks.
Herpesviral encephalitis and herpesviral meningitis
Rates of infection are determined by the presence of antibodies against either viral species.
Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners; a person with a history of infection (HSV seropositive) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person.
The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks vary greatly between people.
Some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully verified; no significant differences are seen in the frequency of asymptomatic shedding when comparing persons with one to 12 annual recurrences to those with no recurrences.
As many as one in seven Canadians  aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may be unaware of their status, a new study suggests.
An important source of support is the ''National Herpes Resource Center'' which arose from the work of the American Social Health Association (ASHA).
Herpes simplex virus 2 is  typically contracted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual, but can also be contracted by exposure to infected saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or the fluid from herpetic blisters.
Concurrent infection with HIV increases the frequency and duration of asymptomatic shedding.
In the presence of a certain gene variation (APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers), HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
HSV infection causes several distinct medical disorders.
HSV-1 more commonly causes oral infections while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections.
Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA.
On occasion, infection occurs on the toes or on the nail cuticle.
Individuals who participate in contact sports such as wrestling, rugby, and football(soccer), sometimes acquire a condition caused by HSV-1 known as herpes gladiatorum, scrumpox, wrestler's herpes, or mat herpes, which presents as skin ulceration on the face, ears, and neck.

Pedro Cuatrecasas states, "during the R&D of acyclovir (Zovirax), marketing department of Burroughs Wellcome insisted that there were 'no markets' for this compound.
In HSV-1-infected individuals, seroconversion after an oral infection prevents additional HSV-1 infections such as whitlow, genital herpes, and herpes of the eye.
Some evidence indicates genetics play a role in the frequency of cold sore outbreaks.
The risk is not eliminated, however, as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic.
Analgesics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) can reduce pain and fever.
In many infections, the first symptom people will have of their own infections is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term.
An estimated 536 million people worldwide (16% of the population) were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and those in the developing world.

Infection occurs when the virus comes into contact with oral mucosa or abraded skin.
A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom, as it covers the labia.
Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis.
Protection against herpes simplex depends on the site of the ulcer; therefore, if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms, abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission.
The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute gingivitis.
This is especially true of new or potential sexual partners whom they consider casual.

These feelings usually lessen over time.
This theory has been contested, however, since HSV is detected in large numbers of individuals having never experienced facial paralysis, and higher levels of antibodies for HSV are not found in HSV-infected individuals with Bell's palsy compared to those without.
Although the exact cause of Bell's palsy—a type of facial paralysis—is unknown, it may be related to reactivation of HSV-1.
There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure.
Until the 1980s serological tests for antibodies to HSV were rarely useful to diagnosis and not routinely used in clinical practice.

These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs.
Following active infection, herpes viruses establish a latent infection in sensory and autonomic ganglia of the nervous system.
The risk of transmission from mother to baby is highest if the mother becomes infected around the time of delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child.

As a result of primary infection, the body produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved, preventing a subsequent infection of that type at a different site.
Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic, occurring on average four or five times a year when not using antiviral therapy.
After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong.
HSV asymptomatic shedding occurs at some time in most individuals infected with herpes.
If an oral HSV-1 infection is contracted first, seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection.

Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity.
The virus cannot pass through a synthetic condom, but a male condom's effectiveness is limited  because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it.
They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual.

In the case of a genital infection, sores can appear at the original site of infection or near the base of the spine, the buttocks, or the back of the thighs.
Some individuals' outbreaks can be quite debilitating, with large, painful lesions persisting for several weeks, while others experience only minor itching or burning for a few days.
Antibodies that develop following an initial infection with a type of HSV prevents reinfection with the same virus type—a person with a history of orofacial infection caused by HSV-1 cannot contract herpes whitlow or a genital infection caused by HSV-1.
Primary orofacial herpes is readily identified by clinical examination of persons with no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection.
Many HSV-infected people experience recurrence within the first year of infection.
When symptomatic, the typical manifestation of a primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection is clusters of inflamed papules and vesicles on the outer surface of the genitals resembling cold sores.
By figuring out how to switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times,  conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells.
