Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains.
One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.
More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged.
Rebellions are "concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage".
The ultimatum game is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone looses their money).
A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation.
Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.
In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century.
Marx writes about "the hidden structure of society" that must be elucidated through an examination of "the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers".
Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the "center" of collective action.
Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: "peasants ... provided the dynamite to bring down the old building".
''International Pressures''
Political Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an "occupational choice".
Failure of top-down bureaucratic reforms, eventual dissolution of the state and widespread peasant revolts against all privately owned land
Kalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts.
Violence is thus not a "man to man" affair as much as a :state to state" struggle, if not an "idea vs idea" conflict.
They identify three main types of grievance arguments:
To "fix" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.
Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.
* Riot, a form of civil disorder involving violent public disturbance
Suicide operations "can be explained as a costly signal of “commitment” to the community".
The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.
# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords.
Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress.
"Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures."
Thus, Olson shows that "selective incentives", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.
Johnson writes "to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure".
As a corollary, this means that some "revolutions" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society.
More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the "landed upper class" and the "imperial state".
Before being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian E.P.
The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process.
Extensive growth, geographically unbalanced
Karl Marx's analysis of revolutions sees such expression of political violence not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power.
A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations.
Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite.
# Leadership "viability and trust" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.
This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views.
Popkin stresses this "investor logic" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital.
* Subversion, which are non-overt attempts at sabotaging a government, carried out by spies or other subversives
However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors.
Spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott in his  book ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'', the moral economy school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel.
Johnson emphasizes "the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way".
Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action.
However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected.
Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.
Blattman and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice ("grievance") in the roots of rebellions.
The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change.
Economist Eli Berman and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership.
The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops.
In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality.
In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas.
''Organization of Agrarian Communities''
Instead, the focus must be on "local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics".
They further note "Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility."
Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the "external relations" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government.
# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power.
Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea.
Berman and Laitin discuss suicide operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual.
Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values.
The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.
Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power.
They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection.
Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics.
He proposes two models to analyze political violence:
It refers to the  open resistance against the orders of an established authority.
Conditions for Peasant Insurrections (B)
The upper class works in a logic of profit maximization, meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources.
Landed nobility has no influence in absolutist state
Social norms, he writes, are "malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals" Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make.
According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies.
The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie.
# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high.
# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action
In other words, anecdotal.
# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;
More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class.
Kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:
Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium.
Stathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.
# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise.
Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.
Breakdown of absolutist state, disorganized peasant upheavals but no autonomous revolts against landowners
Kalyvas writes: "Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism".
The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel.
Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that "a poor person's best strategy" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.
# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state.
As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:
Indeed, the central tenant of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in Capital, is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit.
# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any "direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat".
In fact, he argues the "free rider" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action.
Peasants own 60% of the land, pay rent to landowners that are part of the community
# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;
Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as "riotous", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined.
Peasants own 30-40% of the land own and must pay tribute to the feudal landlord
This is what Tilly calls "multiple sovereignty".
* Terrorism, which is carried out by different kinds of political, economic or religious militant individuals or groups
Furthermore, rebellion is not "a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence".
Relatively autonomous, distant control from royal officials
Without any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders.
* Mutiny, which is carried out by military or security forces against their commanders
That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse.
Strong, imperialist intrusions
In political terms, rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims.
While the later aims to change the polity, the former is "rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below".
The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.
An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.
There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of preferences.
Tilly labels those two groups "members" and "challengers".
More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members club goods, public goods that are reserved only for the members inside that group.
The following theories broadly build on the Marxist interpretation of rebellion.
These variable,s they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented.
# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up.
# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, "whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity".
# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion)
Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.
In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel.
Revolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.
The term comes from the Latin verb ''rebellō,'' "I renew war" (from ''re-'' ("again") + ''bellō'' ("I wage war/I revolt").
Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible.
Breakdown of absolutist state, important peasant revolts against feudal system
They range from those with positive connotations to those with pejorative connotations.
Rebellion can be individual or collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance, and nonviolent resistance) or violent (Terrorism, sabotage and guerrilla warfare.)
The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.
Thompson goes on to write: "the riots were legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people".
These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well.
Moderate, pressure from England
Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.
They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities.
The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism.
Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself.
* Revolution, which is carried out by radicals, usually meant to overthrow the current government
Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.
The goal of rebellion is resistance while a revolt seeks a revolution.
The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.
Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for collective action.
Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.
Landlords dominate local politics under the supervision of Imperial officials
Thus, the term ''rebellion'' also refers to the ensemble of rebels in a state of revolt.
# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall.
Sovereign, supervised by the bureaucracy
Societal Transformations (A + B)
The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.
The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities.
This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him.
All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to "mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations".
In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.
One of his key insight is that "The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity".
If rebellion generally seeks to evade an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws.
# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action
Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision.
Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:
According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability.
The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on "the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.
A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit.
The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary.
Peasants own 50% of the land and pay rent to the landowners, work exclusively on small plots, no real peasant community
Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.
The following theories are all based on Mancur Olson's work in ''The Logic of Collective Action'',a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent problem with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits.
Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.
In ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', Charles Tilly argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society.
# ''Intrinsic incentives'' holds that "injustice or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution".
In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.
# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions.
Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.
Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances.
The rebel is the individual that partakes in rebellion or rebellious activities, particularly when armed.
Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.
A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.
Anger is thus comparative.
This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation.
According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization.
Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more).
Vollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well.
Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied "portofolio" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic.
Samuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.''
Conditions for Political Crises (A)
There are a number of terms that are associated with ''rebel'' and ''rebellion''.
# ''Loss aversion'' holds that "people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse".
Civil resistance movements have often aimed at, and brought about, the fall of a government or head of state, and in these cases could be considered a form of rebellion.
Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society.
Extreme, string of defeats culminating with WW1
Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause.
In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a public good, meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.
It is far from irrational and spontaneous.
# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution.
Thus the term "rebel" does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting as a defender of legality and constitutionalism.
Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning "a belief that the peasants were defending traditional rights and customs".
Thompson was the first to use the term "moral economy" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.
The greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two.
* Civil resistance, civil disobedience, and nonviolent resistance which do not include violence or paramilitary force .
Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing "objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions".
The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-adverse.
A healthy society, meaning a "value-coordinated social system" does not experience political violence.
Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions.
Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order.
The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization.
'''Rebellion''', '''uprising''', or '''insurrection''' is a refusal of obedience or order.
The "revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero sum game.
He labels it formally as the "perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities".
Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage.
