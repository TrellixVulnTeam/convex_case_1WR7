It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.
Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments.
Shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life.
Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean.
