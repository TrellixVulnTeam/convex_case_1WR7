Those traditions which trace a line of initiatory descent back to Gerald Gardner include Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca and the Algard tradition; because of their joint history, they are often referred to as British Traditional Wicca, particularly in North America.
These include Cochrane's Craft and the 1734 Tradition, both of which trace their origins to Robert Cochrane; Feri, which traces itself back to Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen; and Dianic Wicca, whose followers often trace their influences back to Zsuzsanna Budapest.
This allows many Wiccans to believe that mediums are able to contact the spirits of the deceased, a belief that it adopted from Spiritualism.
Modern scholarly investigations have concluded that Witch trials were substantially fewer than the number claimed by Gardner, and seldom held at the behest of religious authorities.
Similar in use to the grimoires of ceremonial magicians, the Book contained instructions for how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like ''Eko Eko Azarak'' to use in those rituals.
Revealing oneself as Wiccan to family, friends or colleagues is often termed "coming out of the broom-closet".
Gardner's original intention was that every copy of the Book would be different, because a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered.
Beltane, aka May Eve or May Day
The purpose of this is to present the infant to the God and Goddess for protection.
# Casting the circle
The Neopagan researcher and High Priestess Margot Adler, who defined ritual as being "one method of reintegrating individuals and groups into the cosmos, and to tie in the activities of daily life with their ever present, often forgotten, significance" noted that rituals, celebrations and rites of passage in Wicca are not "dry, formalised, repetitive experiences", but are performed with the purpose of inducing a religious experience in the participants, thereby altering their consciousness.
From this, they developed a median estimate of 800,000 members.
The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of Doreen Valiente, who developed it from Gardner's version.
In BTW, initiation only accepts someone into the first degree.
In the Egyptologist Margaret Murray's ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1933), in which she dealt with what she believed to be a historical Witch-Cult, she stated that the four main festivals had survived Christianisation and had been celebrated in the pagan Witchcraft religion.
Some traditions, collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca, strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term ''Wicca'' to apply only to similar traditions, but not to newer, eclectic traditions.
To a lesser extent, Wicca also drew upon folk magic and the practices of cunning folk.
Wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice.
Eclectic approaches to Wicca often draw on Earth religion and ancient Egyptian, Greek, Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Asian, Jewish, and Polynesian traditions.
Also in the Book are examples of poetry largely composed by Gardner and his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, the most notable of which is the ''Charge of the Goddess''.
The first known Wiccan wedding ceremony took part in 1960 amongst the Bricket Wood coven, between Frederic Lamond and his first wife, Gillian.
Conversely, in various forms of popular culture, such as television programs ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Charmed'', the word "Wicca" has been used as a synonym for witchcraft more generally, including in non-religious and non-Pagan forms.
As in other forms of Wicca, some Goddess monotheists have expressed the view that the Goddess is not an entity with a literal existence, but rather a Jungian archetype.
Gardner stated that beyond Wicca's two deities was the "Supreme Deity" or "Prime Mover", an entity that was too complex for humans to understand.
Although Gardner criticised monotheism, citing the Problem of Evil, explicitly monotheistic forms of Wicca developed in the 1960s, when the U.S.-based Church of Wicca developed a theology rooted in the worship of what they described as "one deity, without gender".
Wicca is typically duotheistic, worshipping a Goddess and a God.
After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.
By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.
In accordance with the importance put on free will in Wicca, the child is not expected or required to adhere to Wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they reach adulthood.
The witch-cult theory represented "the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself", with the early Wiccans claiming to be the survivors of this ancient pagan religion.
In other traditions however, practices are never written down, meaning that there is no need for a Book of Shadows.
Belief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans, and does not occupy a central place within the religion.
The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage, and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of "lineage papers" proving the authenticity of her status.
Alongside "Wicca", two other names often used for the religion by its practitioners are "Witchcraft" and "the Craft".
There are many such traditions and there are also many solitary practitioners who do not align themselves with any particular lineage, working alone.
However, Gardner did refer to witches as "the Wica".
31 October to 1 November
Detractors typically depict Wicca as a form of malevolent Satanism.
Many notable figures of early Wicca were direct initiates of this coven, including Dafo, Doreen Valiente, Jack Bracelin, Frederic Lamond, Dayonis, Eleanor Bone and Lois Bourne.
Gaelic Polytheism (''see also'' Gaels)
Southern Hemisphere
Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms, thereby technically allowing them to be atheists.
In typical rites, the coven or solitary assembles inside a ritually cast and purified magic circle.
Gerald Gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens, known as the Book of Shadows (among other names), which he would frequently add to and adapt.
Although pronounced differently, the Modern English term "Wicca" is derived from Middle English ''wicche'', which itself comes from Old English ''wicca'' () and ''wicce'' (), the masculine term for wizard/sorcerer and the feminine term for witch, respectively, that was used in Anglo-Saxon England.
The Cochranian tradition, which is not BTW, but based upon the teachings of Robert Cochrane, does not have the three degrees of initiation, merely having the stages of novice and initiate.
The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by Monique Wilson and further popularised by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca.
However, the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts, instead exhibiting a form of universalism.
The Mother Goddess has been associated with life, fertility, and the springtime, and has been described as an ideal role model for women.
The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from Germanic pagan holidays.
Thus, by the 1980s, there were two competing definitions of the word "Wicca" in use among the Pagan and esoteric communities, one broad and inclusive, the other smaller and exclusionary.
This three-tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to BTW, and traditions heavily based upon it.
Although not accepted by all Wiccans, a belief in reincarnation is the dominant afterlife belief within Wicca, having been originally espoused by Gardner.
It is unclear if he ever called it "Wicca", although he did refer to the collective community of Pagan Witches as "the Wica" (with one ''c'').
Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment, but this is not a necessity, and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven.
Many traditions hold a belief in the five classical elements, although they are seen as symbolic as representations of the phases of matter.
31 October to 1 November
In Valiente's poem, they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.
Although different Wiccans attribute different traits to the Horned God, he is most often associated with animals and the natural world, but also with the afterlife, and he is furthermore often viewed as an ideal role model for men.
In certain ''Traditional Witchcraft'' traditions, different forms of literature are used, for instance in the 1734 Tradition, the published articles of Robert Cochrane along with letters he wrote to Joseph Wilson, Robert Graves and others are held in high esteem whilst in the Sabbatic tradition, various grimoires are followed, such as the ''Azoetia'' of Andrew Chumbley.
Understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners; the prominent Wiccan Raymond Buckland for instance insisted that the souls of humans would only ever incarnate into human bodies, whereas other Wiccans believe that the soul of a human can incarnate into any other life form.
Eclectic practitioners may follow their own individual ideas and ritual practices, while still drawing on one or more religious or philosophical paths.
Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil.
A central aspect of Wicca (particularly in Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca), often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude, also known as ''skyclad''.
Gardner's tradition, later termed Gardnerianism, soon became the dominant form in England and spread to other parts of the British Isles.
To proceed to the second degree, an initiate has to go through another ceremony, in which they name and describe the uses of the ritual tools and implements.
When covens grow beyond their ideal number of members, they often split (or "hive") into multiple covens, yet remain connected as a group.
The Craft is a place where all of these things fit together – beauty, pageantry, music, dance, song, dream."
In his Book of Shadows, there are texts taken from various sources, including Charles Godfrey Leland's ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'' (1899) and the works of 19th–20th century occultist Aleister Crowley, whom Gardner knew personally.
In a similar way, some people have accused Wicca of being anti-Christian, a claim disputed by Wiccans such as Doreen Valiente, who stated that whilst she knew many Wiccans who admired Jesus, "witches have little respect for the doctrines of the churches, which they regard as a lot of man-made dogma".
Among witches in Canada, anthropologist Dr. Heather Botting (nee Harden) of the University of Victoria has been one of the most prominent, having been the first recognized Wiccan chaplain of a public university.
The first of these to be published was in Paul Huson's ''Mastering Witchcraft'' (1970), and unusually involved recitation of the Lord's Prayer backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical Witch Hunt.
In nearly all cases it is instead performed "in token", thereby merely symbolically, using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb.
The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves the participation of the Great Rite, either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual flagellation.
Gardner himself made use of the English names of these holidays, stating that "the four great Sabbats are Candlemass, May Eve, Lammas, and Halloween; the equinoxes and solstices are celebrated also."
Other traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes.
Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe.
Valiente rewrote Gardner's version in verse, keeping the material derived from ''Aradia'', but removing the material from Crowley.
Gardner was a retired British civil servant and amateur anthropologist, with a broad familiarity in paganism and occultism.
The first recorded use of the word "Wicca" appears in 1962, and it had been popularised to the extent that several British practitioners founded a newsletter called ''The Wiccan'' in 1968.
Several academics have also categorised Wicca as a form of nature religion, a term that is also embraced by many of the faith's practitioners.
The ritual is first; the myth is second.
Wicca is also a form of Western esotericism, and more specifically a part of the esoteric current known as occultism.
The Goddess is often portrayed as a Triple Goddess, thereby being a triadic deity comprising a Maiden goddess, a Mother goddess, and a Crone goddess, each of whom has different associations, namely virginity, fertility and wisdom.
For the 2011 census a more detailed breakdown of responses was reported with 56,620 people identifying themselves as Pagans, 11,766 as Wiccans and a further 1,276 describing their religion as "Witchcraft".
The High Priest and Craft historian Aidan Kelly claimed that the practices and experiences within Wicca were actually far more important than the beliefs, stating that "it's a religion of ritual rather than theology.
The theory's most prominent advocate was the English Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who promoted it in a series of books &ndash; most notably 1921's ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' and 1933's ''The God of the Witches'' &ndash; and in her entry on "witchcraft" for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.
While the origins of modern Wiccan practice lie in covenantal activity of select few initiates in established lineages, eclectic Wiccans are more often than not solitary practitioners uninitiated in any tradition.
There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time.
In some covens a "dedication" ceremony may be performed during this period, some time before the initiation proper, allowing the person to attend certain rituals on a probationary basis.
Intent on perpetuating this craft, Gardner founded the Bricket Wood coven with his wife Donna in the 1940s, after buying the Naturist Fiveacres Country Club.
Rituals observed may display cultural influence from the holidays from which they take their name as well as influence from other unrelated cultures.
Although there are exceptions, among scholars of Pagan studies it is the older, inclusive use of the term which has gained wider usage.
The full flowering of spring; fairy folk
Various analogies have been devised to explain the concept of the five elements; for instance, the Wiccan Ann-Marie Gallagher used that of a tree, which is composed of earth (with the soil and plant matter), water (sap and moisture), fire (through photosynthesis) and air (the creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide), all of which are believed to be united through spirit.
Vernal equinox and the beginning of spring
There is also a common Wiccan belief that any Witches will come to be reincarnated as future Witches, an idea originally expressed by Gardner.
Another common element of Wiccan morality is the Law of Threefold Return which holds that whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return to that person with triple force, or with equal force on each of the three levels of body, mind and spirit, similar to the eastern idea of karma.
Its traditional core beliefs, principles and practices were originally outlined in the 1940s and 1950s by Gardner and Doreen Valiente, both in published books as well as in secret written and oral teachings passed along to their initiates.
Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by ceremonial magicians, such as Aleister Crowley, who declared that magic was "the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will", while another prominent ceremonial magician, MacGregor Mathers stated that it was "the science of the control of the secret forces of nature".
He has also been seen in the roles of the Leader of the Wild Hunt and the Lord of Death.
Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente's ''Charge of the Goddess'', these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power, and compassion.
Even among theistic Wiccans, there are divergent beliefs, and Wicca includes pantheists, monotheists, duotheists, and polytheists.
Many early Wiccans, such as Alex Sanders, Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield, referred to their own magic as "white magic", which contrasted with "black magic", which they associated with evil and Satanism.
Winter solstice and the rebirth of the Sun
Eclectic Wicca is not necessarily the complete abandonment of tradition.
Such a view was purported by the High Priestess Vivianne Crowley, herself a psychologist, who considered the Wiccan deities to be Jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual.
In the United Kingdom, census figures on religion were first collected in 2001; no detailed statistics were reported outside of the six main religions.
Subsequent, more overtly pagan self-initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like Doreen Valiente, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf.
Theological views within Wicca are diverse, and the religion encompasses theists, atheists, and agnostics, with some viewing the religion's deities as entities with a literal existence and others viewing them as Jungian archetypes or symbols.
Other traditions, however, do not hold this to be necessary.
Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from Hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls.
Infants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a Wiccaning, which is analogous to a Christening.
There are many rituals within Wicca that are used when celebrating the Sabbats, worshipping the deities and working magic.
A more strictly polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right.
Wiccans have also made up significant proportions of various groups within that country; for instance, Wicca is the largest non-Christian faith practised in the United States Air Force, with 1,434 airmen identifying themselves as such.
Valiente, one of Gardner's original High Priestesses, argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the by-product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven – the others were later additions made by Alex Sanders during the 1960s.
Casting the circle may involve the invocation of the "Guardians" of the cardinal points, alongside their respective classical elements; air, fire, water and earth.
By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens.
Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences.
It is not known who precisely invented the term "Wicca" in reference to the religion, although one possibility is that it might have been Gardner's rival Charles Cardell, who was referring to it as the "Craft of the Wiccens" by 1958.
The names of these festivals are in some cases taken from the Old Irish fire festivals, though in most traditional Wiccan covens the only commonality with the Celtic festival is the name.
Subsequently, when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s, many of the early groups, such as Robert Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain and Gerald Gardner's Bricket Wood coven adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray.
The actual number of Wiccans worldwide is unknown, and it has been noted that it is more difficult to establish the numbers of members of Neopagan faiths than many other religions due to their disorganised structure.
These usually include a knife called an athame, a wand, a pentacle and a chalice, but other tools include a broomstick known as a besom, a cauldron, candles, incense and a curved blade known as a boline.
It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant.
For instance, the God has been interpreted as the Oak King and the Holly King, as well as the Sun God, Son/Lover God, and Vegetation God.
Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven.
# Calling of the elemental quarters
Perhaps the most significant of these is an initiation ritual, through which somebody joins the Craft and becomes a Wiccan.
Autumnal equinox; the harvest of grain
In this manner, all BTW's can trace a direct line of descent all the way back to Gardner.
It was in the United States and in Australia that new, home-grown traditions, sometimes based upon earlier, regional folk-magical traditions and often mixed with the basic structure of Gardnerian Wicca, began to develop, including Victor Anderson's Feri Tradition, Joseph Wilson's 1734 Tradition, Aidan Kelly's New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn and eventually Zsuzsanna Budapest's Dianic Wicca, each of which emphasised different aspects of the faith.
However, the Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White noted that the use of the word "Witchcraft" in this context was problematic because the term resulted in the religion being easily confused both with other, non-religious forms of witchcraft as well as other religions &ndash; such as Satanism and Luciferianism &ndash; whose practitioners sometimes describe themselves as "Witches".
Various rites of passage can be found within Wicca.
In the rare case of the Ros an Bucca group from Cornwall, only six are adhered to.
Indeed, many U.S. covens are far smaller, though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated Wiccans at "open" rituals.
First signs of spring
Wicca's duotheism has been compared to the Taoist system of yin and yang.
There are also covens that have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition, instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically.
This less formal but more accessible form of Wicca proved successful.
This belief has been endorsed by other prominent practitioners, who have referred to it as "the Cosmic Logos", "Supreme Cosmic Power", or "Godhead".
Lughnasadh, aka Lammas
When the religion first came to public attention, it was commonly called "Witchcraft".
Original high priestess of Coven Celeste, she is one of the founders of the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church.
Other Craft groups have associated the elements with different cardinal points, for instance Robert Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain associated earth with south, fire with east, water with west and air with north, and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary Horned God and Goddess.
Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses in order to achieve surprising results, whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so.
Prominent groups within this Traditional Witchcraft revival included Andrew Chumbley's Cultus Sabbati and the Cornish Ros an Bucca coven.
# Purification of the sacred space and the participants
Some Wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day, which some traditions hold should be contracted on the Sabbat of Lughnasadh, as this was the traditional time for trial, "Telltown marriages" among the Irish.
Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science, and as such they do not view it as being supernatural, but a part of what Leo Martello calls the "super powers that reside in the natural".
Many Wiccans also adopt a more explicitly polytheistic or animistic world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings.
A widening public appetite, especially in the United States, made traditional initiation unable to satisfy demand for involvement in Wicca.
For example, in the 1996 book ''Witches and Neighbors'', Robin Briggs examines the history of witchcraft in medieval Europe and refutes the widely told story that large numbers of independent women were burned at the stake by vindictive Christian ecclesiastics for the crime of practising naturalistic healing or neopagan religion.
Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca.
According to new-age religious scholar James R. Lewis, in his book ''Witchcraft today: an encyclopaedia of Wiccan and neopagan traditions'', a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third-degree high priestess (in the orthodox Gardnerian system).
In Canada, Dr. Heather Botting ("Lady Aurora") and Dr. Gary Botting ("Pan"), the original high priestess and high priest of Coven Celeste and founding elders of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, successfully campaigned the British Columbian government and the federal government in 1995 to allow them to perform recognised Wiccan weddings, to become prison and hospital chaplains, and (in the case of Heather Botting) to become the first officially recognized Wiccan chaplain in a public university.
As a name for the religion, "Wicca" developed in Britain during the 1960s.
No historical pagan equivalent.
She then becomes eligible to wear the "moon crown".
Initiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day.
The five elements are symbolised by the five points of the pentagram, the most prominently used symbol of Wicca.
The other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as ''Lesser Sabbats'', and comprise the solstices and the equinoxes, and were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven, before subsequently being adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition, and eventually other traditions like Alexandrian Wicca and the Dianic tradition.
Sanders also used the similar terminology of "left hand path" to describe malevolent magic, and "right hand path" to describe magic performed with good intentions; terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century.
For instance, those living on the east coast of North America should invoke water in the east and not the west because the colossal body of water, the Atlantic ocean, is to their east.
For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as the "Great Goddess" and the "Great Horned God", with the adjective "great" connoting a deity that contains many other deities within their own nature.
which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones.
Wicca often involves the ritual practice of magic, though it is not always necessary.
Some solitary Wiccans also perform self-initiation rituals, to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan.
Collectively, these occasions are termed the Wheel of the Year.
# Wine, cakes, chanting, dancing, games
In many cases these spirits are associated with the natural world, for instance as ''genius loci'', fairies, and elementals.
Traditionally in the Gardnerian Craft, each element has been associated with a cardinal point of the compass; air with east, fire with south, water with west, earth with north, and the spirit with centre.
In the United States, the American Religious Identification Survey has shown significant increases in the number of self-identified Wiccans, from 8,000 in 1990, to 134,000 in 2001, and 342,000 in 2008.
Many Wiccans believe in magic, a manipulative force exercised through the practice of witchcraft or sorcery.
The Witchcraft religion became more prominent beginning in 1951, with the repeal of the Witchcraft Act of 1735, after which Gerald Gardner and then others such as Charles Cardell and Cecil Williamson began publicising their own versions of the Craft.
It is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name.
In his 1999 book ''The Triumph of the Moon'', Bristol University history professor Ronald Hutton researched the Wiccan claim that ancient pagan customs have survived into modern times after being Christianised in medieval times as folk practices.
It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, sects and denominations, referred to as ''traditions'', each with its own organizational structure and level of centralisation.
The Wiccan Rede was most likely introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente, one of his High Priestesses.
These are traditionally viewed as the Moon Goddess and the Horned God, respectively.
Although recognised as a religion by academics, some evangelical Christians have attempted to deny it legal recognition as such, while some Wiccan practitioners themselves eschew the term "religion" &ndash; associating the latter purely with organised religion &ndash; instead favouring "spirituality" or "way of life".
During the 1960s, the name of the religion normalised to "Wicca".
Handfasting is another celebration held by Wiccans, and is the commonly used term for their weddings.
Gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of "a year and a day" between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated, although he frequently broke this rule with initiates.
These five elements are invoked during many magical rituals, notably when consecrating a magic circle.
As such they are often interpreted as being "embodiments of a life-force manifest in nature".
# Drawing down the Gods
By adopting it for modern usage, Wiccans were both symbolically cementing their connection to the ancient, pre-Christian past, and adopting a self-designation that would be less controversial than "Witchcraft".
Common to these divergent perspectives, however, is that Wicca's deities are viewed as forms of ancient, pre-Christian divinities by its practitioners.
Once the circle is cast, a seasonal ritual may be performed, prayers to the God and Goddess are said, and spells are sometimes worked; these may include various forms of 'raising energy', including raising a cone of power for the purposes of sending healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space.
However, with the rise of more and more such groups, often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage, the term came to be a synonym for a religious denomination within Wicca.
Another term that is at times used as a synonym for "Wicca" is "Pagan Witchcraft", although Doyle White again critiqued the utility of this term by noting that there were forms of modern Paganism &ndash; such as types of Heathenry &ndash; which also practiced magic and thus could also be described as "Pagan Witchcraft".
The terms ''wizard'' and ''warlock'' are generally discouraged in the community.
In British Traditional Wiccan (BTW) traditions, there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to Gerald Gardner, and from him is said to go back to the New Forest coven; however, the existence of this coven remains unproven.
Aether unites the other four.
Parents are advised to "give  children the gift of Wicca" in a manner suitable to their age.
Covens are autonomous, and are generally headed by a High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership, being a couple who have each been through their first, second and third degrees of initiation.
A course of study may be set during this period.
Gardner's wording of the original "Charge" added extracts from the works of Aleister Crowley's work, including ''The Book of the Law'', (especially from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess) thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the revelations of Thelema.
