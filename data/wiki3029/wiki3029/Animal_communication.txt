Animals communicate to other animals with various signs: visual, sound, echolocation, vibrations, body language, and smell.
'''Animal communication''' is the transfer of information from one or a group of animals (sender or senders) to one or more other animals (receiver or receivers) which affects either the current or future behavior of the receivers.
Some forms of mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured in the same way as wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection.
Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly.
Another example of prey to predator communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal.
Similar results have also recently been reported in the Campbell's mona monkey.
A sound known onomatopoeiacally as the "pyow" warns against a lurking leopard, and a coughing sound that scientists call a "hack" is used when an eagle is flying nearby.
It has been reported  that bottlenose dolphins can recognize identity information from whistles even when otherwise stripped of the characteristics of the whistle; making dolphins the only animals other than humans that have been shown to transmit identity information independent of the caller’s voice or location.
Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers.
Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unproﬁtable because the signaler is prepared to escape.
Mating signals can also include the use of olfactory signals or calls unique to a species.
Animals that form lasting pair bonds often have symmetrical displays that they make to each other.
This may include running for cover, becoming immobile, or gathering into a group to reduce the risk of attack.
a courtship display) or it may be unintentional (e.g.
Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood.
A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is ''stotting'' (sometimes called ''pronking''), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some antelopes such as Thomson's gazelle in the presence of a predator.
yawns, direction of vision, all convey meaning.
Much animal communication occurs between members of the species and this is the context in which it has been most intensively studied.
Psychological interpretations of animal behavior are often anthropomorphized, leading to wrong conclusions.
&#x5B;a command telling others to move&#x5D;...
During mating, touch stimuli are important for pair positioning, coordination and genital stimulation.
The ability to sense infrared (IR) thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of snakes.
For example, Desmond Morris showed in a study of grass finches that a beak-wiping response occurred in a range of species, serving a preening function, but that in some species this had been elaborated into a courtship signal.
These signals frequently involve the display of body parts or postures.
At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed.
Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure.
Sean Senechal, at the AnimalSign Center has been using an approach similar to this FCT with domesticated animals, such as dogs (since 2004) and horses (since 2000) with encouraging results and benefits to the animals and people.
This is simply because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.
Such signals can advertise prey’s ability to escape, and reﬂect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement).
Common vampire bats (''Desmodus rotundus'') have specialized IR sensors in their nose-leaf.
# Human languages combine elements to produce new messages (a property known as '''creativity''').
The first is the good genes hypothesis.
A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it.
It is interesting to note that dogs do not make use of direction of gaze or exhibit left gaze bias with other dogs.
This led to the realization that communication might not always be "honest" (indeed, there are some obvious examples where it is not, as in mimicry).
This allows all members of a social group (and sometimes other species) to respond accordingly.
The implications are that primates at least may be able to ignore the usual relationship between an individual alarm call, and the meaning it might convey under certain circumstances... To our knowledge this is the first good evidence of a syntax-like natural communication system in a non-human species."
This explains that the peacock's tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators.
This appears far less common in animal communication systems, although current research into animal culture is still an ongoing process with many new discoveries.
Sociobiologists argued that behaviours that benefited a whole group of animals might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual.
The structure of swim bladders and the attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families, resulting in a wide range of sound production.

* '''Communication during contests''': Animal communication plays a vital role in determining the winner of contest over a resource.
It is not so hard to describe, but to give the right meaning to behavior is much harder.
A good example is warning colouration: species such as wasps that are capable of harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal.
Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.
Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately - but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call.
One example is the 'play face' in dogs which signals that a subsequent aggressive signal is part of a play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.
There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding.
An experiment on chimpanzees shows that a small “dose of anthropomorphizing” often gives better scientific results than when researchers try to describe all behavior objectively, but skepticism remains for this concept.
Another means of auditory communication is the vibration of swim bladders in bony fish.
For more information on bird song, see bird vocalization.
Most of the forms and functions of communication described above are relevant to intraspecific communication.
The primary function of chemical reception is to detect resources (i.e.
Weakly electric fishes are an example of electrocommunication tied with an active sensory modality for electrolocation.

In 1955, Cherry said “meaning is... like the beauty of a complexion; it lies altogether in the eye of the beholder”.
The paper concludes that:
Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot.
For example, a domestic dog's simple tail wag may be used in subtly different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals published in 1872.
For instance, a small minnow species may do well to avoid habitat with a detectable concentration of chemical cue associated with a predator species such as northern pike.
Minnows with the ability to perceive the presence of predators before they are close enough to be seen and then respond with adaptive behavior (such as hiding) are more likely to survive and reproduce, as will their offspring due to the nature of inheritance (heredity).

By teaching these animals a gestural (human made) American Sign Language-like language, the animals have been found to use the new signs on their own to get what they need.
Other examples include bill clacking in birds, wing clapping in manakin courtship displays, and chest beating in gorillas.
In a number of species, males perform calls during mating rituals as a form of competition against other males and to signal females, including hammer-headed bats, red deer, humpback whales, elephant seals, and songbirds.
The recent experiments on animal language are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.
Depending on the context, they might be considered to be predator to prey communication, or to reflect forms of commensalism.
It is important for these alarm calls to be distinguishable, so that the monkeys can recognize the threat and respond appropriately.
The first good evidence of syntax in non-humans, reported in 2006, is from the greater spot-nosed monkey (''Cercopithecus nictitans'') of Nigeria.
The right interpretation of animal behavior can be critical, such as clinical research with laboratory animals.
Exploiting the psychology of the female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter.
A new approach in the 21st century in the field of animal communication uses applied behavioral analysis (ABA), specifically Functional Communication Training (FCT).
Differences and changes in waveforms can be in response to hormones, circadian rhythms, and interactions with other fish.
If an alarm call is given for a python, the monkeys must climb into the trees to avoid the python.
It allows these reptiles to form thermal images of the radiant heat emitted by predators or prey at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.
It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws.
Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully.
Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril (loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales.
Vibrations and other communication channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but can be used in multi-modal communication.
“the degree to which an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise.”  Autocommunication can be divided in two main systems.
All these adaptations require evolutionary explanation.
Not all animals use vocalization as a means of auditory communication.
1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007).
Because of this, generalizations such as "X means Y" are often, but not always, accurate.
Because of the tight linkages between individuals, the entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals.
A gene-centered view of evolution proposes that behaviours that enabled a gene to become wider established within a population would become positively selected for, even if their effect on individuals or the species as a whole was detrimental;
Seismic communication is the exchange of information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass among others.
Touch is also used to announce the intention of the male to mount the female, such as a male kangaroo grabbing the tail of a female.
A popular example of this is the tail tip vibration of rattlesnakes as a warning signal.
The facial pits enabling this sense underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.
There are many functions of animal communication.
: The greater spot-nosed monkeys have two main alarm sounds.
Despite being the oldest method of communication, chemical communication is one of the least understood forms due to the “noisy” nature and sheer abundance of chemicals in our environment, and the difficulty of detecting and measuring all chemical species within a sample.
Typically, predators attempt to reduce communication to prey as this will generally reduce the effectiveness of their hunting.
These include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the peacock's tail, the antlers of a stag and the frill of the frill-necked lizard, but also include even the modest red spot on a European herring gull's bill.
In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact play a major role in group coordination.
Tetrapods for the most part use a body part to drum against the ground to create seismic waves, which in turn are received through the sacculus.
A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys.
Other instances of vocal communication include the alarm calls of the Campbell monkey, the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups.
The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy.
# Human languages are characterized for having a '''double articulation''' (in the characterization of French linguist André Martinet).
In social integration, touch is a widely used communication system.
Crickets and grasshoppers are well known for this, but many others use stridulation as well, including crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, wasps, ants, beetles, butterflies, moths, millipedes, and centipedes.
The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake.
Animal signals, however, do not exhibit this dual structure.
The behaviour to form a rosette is called cycloalexy.
Animal behavior is sometimes very hard to interpret.
In object choice tasks, dogs utilize human communicative gestures such as pointing and direction of gaze in order to locate hidden food and toys.
Altruism towards an unrelated group is not widely accepted in the scientific community, but rather can be seen as reciprocal altruism, expecting the same behaviour from others, a benefit of living in a group.
* '''Mating rituals''':  Animals produce signals to attract the attention of a possible mate or to solidify pair bonds.
Another controversial issue is the extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic capacity.
Certain alterations code for specific conditions which provide information about the environment that can be used to indicate food, predators or conspecifics.
As with human beings, who may smile or hug or stand a particular way for multiple reasons, many animals also re-use gestures.
These fish communicate by generating an electric field using what is known as an electric organ.
Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals.
Significant contributions to the first of these problems were made by Konrad Lorenz and other early ethologists.
Other evidence for the importance of communication in animals is the prioritisation of physiological features to this function, for example, birdsong appears to have brain structures entirely devoted to its production.
The ability to detect chemicals present within the environment allowed organisms to associate advantageous or adaptive behaviors with the information provided by the chemicals.
In contrast, if an alarm call is given for an eagle, the monkeys must get low to the ground and seek a hiding place.
Dogs have shown an ability to understand human communication.
By comparing related species within groups, they showed that movements and body parts that in the primitive forms had no communicative function could be "captured" in a context where communication would be functional for one or both partners, and could evolve into a more elaborate, specialised form.
When given pain relief, their behavior returns to normal.
Ethologists and sociobiologists have characteristically analysed animal communication in terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising the question of whether the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive.
Anthropomorphizing behavior is most often applied to domesticated animals, like cats and dogs, and with apes, because of the close phylogenetic relationship to humans.
Striking body parts together can also produce auditory signals.
Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the ''eyebrow flash'' on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates.
* '''Alarm calls''': Alarm calls communicate the threat of a predator.
Another mechanism for social integration is prolonged physical contact or huddling.
The importance of communication is evident from the highly elaborate morphology, behaviour and physiology that some animals have evolved to facilitate this.
This is the first evidence that some animals can take discrete units of communication, and build them up into a sequence which then carries a different meaning from the individual "words":
In many taxa, signals involve multiple mechanisms, i.e.
On the other hand, the similarities between human behavior and certain animal behavior cannot be ignored.
Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further.
deception by the predator.
Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler's condition.
This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a prexisting bias in the female to select for that trait.
In a fight, touch can be used to challenge an opponent, to coordinate movements during the escalation of the fight, and it can be used by the loser to perform submissive actions afterwards.
In various species, whale vocalizations have been found to have different dialects based on region.
Thus statements that a particular action "means" something, should always be interpreted as "often means".
This provides the opportunity to assess chemical signals of the potential mate, or apply additional chemical signals.
# In general, animal utterances are responses to external stimuli, and do not refer to matters removed in time and space.
There are two aspects to the required explanation:
The second form of autocommunication is echolocation, found in bats and Odontoceti.
File:Expression of the Emotions Figure 4.png|"Small dog watching a cat on a table"
Interpreting animal behavior is vital when considering the context in which the signal is produced.
The IR sense enables Desmodus to localize homeothermic animals such as cattle and horses within a range of about 10 to 15&nbsp;cm.
Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported for a wide variety of taxa, including ﬁsh (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper et al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al.
The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual.
For example, ants leave a pheromone trail on the ground that can be followed by other ants to lead them to the food source.
Matters of relevance at a distance, such as distant food sources, tend to be indicated to other individuals by body language instead, for example wolf activity before a hunt, or the information conveyed in honeybee dance language.It is therefore unclear to what extent utterances are automatic responses and to what extent deliberate intent plays a part.
The same gesture may have multiple meanings, depending on context and other associated behaviors.
a prey animal detecting the scent of a predator).
When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.
* '''Meta-communication''': Signals that will modify the meaning of subsequent signals.
The sacculus is an organ in the inner ear containing a membranous sac that is used for balance aid, but in animals that use this communication can detect seismic waves.
The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of its four different predators.
Some of these include, but are not limited to, frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, and nematode worms.
Young ravens signal will signal to older ravens when they encounter new or untested food.
Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne).
For example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite.
Both the production of the signal from the sender and the perception and subsequent response from the receiver need to coevolve.
Differences in waveforms and frequencies convey information on species, sex, and individuals.
In the case of communication, an important discussion by John Krebs and Richard Dawkins established hypotheses for the evolution of such apparently altruistic or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and courtship signals to emerge under individual selection.
# In contrast to human language, animal communication systems are usually not able to express conceptual generalizations.
Humans also often seek to mimic animals' communicative signals in order to interact with them.
Rhesus macaques will send food calls to inform other monkeys of a food source to avoid punishment.
This context is important for the recipient, humans or otherwise, to get the intended meaning of a signal.
Functional communication training for animals, Senechal calls "AnimalSign Language".
Touch can also be a way to inform conspecifics about the environment.
Another example of an animal that gives alarm calls is the vervet monkey.
For example, a gazelle will assume characteristic poses to initiate mating.
(Cetaceans and some primates may be notable exceptions).
This may take the form of a procession or a rosette.
However, some have been studied in more detail than others.
This includes teaching communication through gestures (like simplified American sign language), Picture Exchange Communication System, tapping, and vocalisation.
Despite the detection of IR radiation, the pits’ IR mechanism is disimilar to photoreceptors; while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the facial pits of snakes is a temperature sensitive ion channel.
One factor in this is that much human language growth is based upon conceptual ideas and hypothetical structures, both being far greater capabilities in humans than animals.
This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original “resting” or “inactive” temperature.
File:Expression of the Emotions Figure 6.png|"Dog in a humble and affectionate frame of mind"
The early ethologists assumed that communication occurred for the good of the species as a whole, but this would require a process of group selection which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the evolution of sexually reproducing animals.
Signalling theory predicts that for the signal to be maintained in the population, the receiver should in most cases receive some benefit from the interaction as well as the sender.
Highly elaborate behaviours have evolved for communication such as the dancing of cranes, the pattern changes of cuttlefish, and the gathering and arranging of materials by bowerbirds.
Combining the information from context and the signal itself, will provide a more thorough meaning of communication.
For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a pet cat to establish a tolerant relationship.
A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost.
There are animals that use seismic communication from a large number of taxa.
When animal communication involves multiple receivers, this may be referred to as an "audience".
This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate.
Crushed ants will release an alarm pheromone to attract more ants and send them into an attack state.
The most widespread behaviour involving touch is allogrooming, the grooming of one animal by another.
There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration.
Since the late 1990s, one scientist, Sean Senechal, has been developing, studying, and using the learned visible, expressive language in dogs and horses.
A recent and interesting area of development is the discovery that the use of syntax in language, and the ability to produce "sentences", is not limited to humans either.
It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.
Famous examples are the mutual presentation of reeds by great crested grebes studied by Julian Huxley, the triumph displays shown by many species of geese and penguins on their nest sites, and the spectacular courtship displays by birds of paradise.
When the information sent from the sender to receiver is either an act or a structure that manipulates the behavior of the receiver, it is referred to as a "signal".
There are however, some actions of prey species that are clearly communications to actual or potential predators.
Pheromones are released by many social insects to lead the other members of the society to the food source.
multimodal signaling.
