In other words, the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent weights.
In organic compounds, such as butane or ethanol, the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced).

In the late 18th century the Italian physician and anatomist Luigi Galvani marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between chemical reactions and electricity on his essay ''"De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius"'' (Latin for Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion) in 1791 where he proposed a ''"nerveo-electrical substance"'' on biological life forms.
This process can yield large amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine, and is widely used on mineral dressing and metallurgy industries.
Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the standard electrode potential is −0.76 V).
Formally, oxidation state is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic.
The emf for this process is approximately −4 V indicating a (very) non-spontaneous process.
He discovered various methods for producing and strengthening magnets.
The loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation, and the gain of electrons is reduction.
This reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a voltage, resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation of copper ions at the cathode.
Sir Humphry Davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge.
This energy is referred to as electrical work and is expressed by the following equation:
In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).
In 1832, Michael Faraday's experiments led him to state his two laws of electrochemistry.
An important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating which together with the first law of electrolysis, has a significant number of applications in the industry, as when used to protect metals to avoid corrosion.

On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion.
In 1889, he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the current.

In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.
Finally, reaction 3 is favorable because it describes the proliferation of OH− ions thus letting a probable reduction of H+ ions less favorable an option.
For reactions involving oxygen, the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced).
This was the ''two-fluid theory'' of electricity, which was to be opposed by Benjamin Franklin's ''one-fluid theory'' later in the century.
Metals can be coated with paint or other less conductive metals (''passivation'').
In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell which solved the problem of polarization by eliminating hydrogen gas generation at the positive electrode.

The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores.
Galvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views, but Alessandro Volta rejected the idea of an ''"animal electric fluid,"'' replying that the frog's legs responded to differences in metal temper, composition, and bulk.
To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing electrolyte mixing.
However, the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both electrodes.

In his essay Galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a here-to-fore neglected innate, vital force, which he termed ''"animal electricity,"'' which activated nerves and muscles spanned by metal probes.
Although the initial analysis is correct, there is another effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect.
The electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree) reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged as needed.
Conversely, loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.
If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode.

A standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes (sometimes called half cell potentials).
If the electrode has a positive potential with respect to the SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard electrode potential of 0.337 V).
Bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes.
