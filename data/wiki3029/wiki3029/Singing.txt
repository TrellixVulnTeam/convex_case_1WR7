* A particular part of the vocal range such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment.
As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop beatboxers, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects.
Hip-hop uses rapping, the rhythmic delivery of rhymes in a rhythmic speech over a beat or without accompaniment.
Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents.
The shape of the chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered.
Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.
# Feet slightly apart
For example, popular music would encompass blues, jazz, country music, easy listening, hip hop, rock music, and several other genres.
Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing.
There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation.
Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract.
This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.
Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.
These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register.
#The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# Hips facing straight forward
The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism.
Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised.
It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual, as part of music education, or as a profession.
Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds.
This is casually known as the “singing center.” By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech.
As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, sight singing and memorizing songs, and basic skills at the piano, to aid in learning new songs and in ear training or vocal exercises.
In popular and jazz styles, college and university degrees are also available, though there are fewer programs.
Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.)
A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.
In addition, “musical syntax .
Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing.
For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "crooning" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone.
might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal .
The pitch is altered with the vocal cords.
** Techniques used in styles such as sostenuto and legato, range extension, tone quality, vibrato, and coloratura
However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories.
It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic Auto-Tune pitch correction devices with recorded and live popular music vocals.
Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.
In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply, or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest and head cavities, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound.
No system is universally applied or accepted.
A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality.
In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that “regional specificity,” such as that for speech, “may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.” Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the “singing center” may be retrained to help produce speech.
Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.
In Classical singing and in some other genres, a knowledge of foreign languages such as French, Italian, German, or other languages, is needed.
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.
Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like birds, gibbons, whales, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species.
They typically take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.
Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume (loudness), timbre, or tone of the sound produced.
In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in gibbon families.)
There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators.
Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register.
In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages.
Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, scalenes and sternocleidomastoid muscles.
Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.
(3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."
It has also been shown that a more powerful voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa.
**Vocal health and voice disorders related to singing
The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:
Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds.
McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less.
can be misleading or even inaccurate.
The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat.
On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who “argued that language is an adaptation and music is its spandrel .
Within speech pathology the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound.
Vocal exercises have several purposes, including warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.
However, one much older study of lung capacity compared those with professional vocal training to those without, and failed to back up the claims of increased lung capacity.
Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises.
In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head.
Jazz or pop singers who perform with dance bands or nightclub show groups can make $225 and up per week.
Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.
'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air.
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique.
If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them.
They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers.
** Voice classification
Vibrato occurs naturally, and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.
* A certain vocal timbre or vocal "color"
Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice.
'''Singing''' is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques.
In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.
These genres include: Art music, Popular music, Traditional music, regional and national music, and fusions of those genres.
Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view.
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia.
However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production.
Popular music includes a range of vocal styles.
Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings.
A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).
For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth.
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that “people who sing are more likely to be happy.” This is because “singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being.” Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable.
an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language” (248).
* A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice.
This is known as vocal resonation.
The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music.
areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca’s area” and “the regions involved in musical semantics .
Registers originate in laryngeal function.
Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass).
These qualities include but are not limited to: vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice.
This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including: speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics.
The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production.
Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto.
Performers in a community choral group can earn from $200–$3,000 yearly; members of a professional concert choral group can make $80 and up per performance.
Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a vocal technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.
The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract.
# Shoulders down and back
There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music.
Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved.
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music.
It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.
#Developing flexibility and agility
#Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be record company A&R representatives, opera or musical theater directors, choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters.
In heavy metal and hardcore punk subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as screams, shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "death growl".
Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register; a vocal resonance area; or a specific vocal timbre.
There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated.
* Vocal styles: for classical singers, this includes styles ranging from Lieder to opera; for pop singers, styles can include "belted out" a blues ballads; for jazz singers, styles can include Swing ballads and scatting.
As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur.
Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
''American Idol'' was one of the prominent of these shows.
Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy.
Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner.
# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations.
Composers who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers.
Within these larger genres are many subgenres.
With the lips closed, this is called humming.
Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance.
'''Vocal music''' is music performed by one or more singers, which are typically called songs, and which may be performed with or without instrumental accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece.
There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as vocalese and scat singing in jazz.
Levitin recounts how in certain studies, “listening to music and attending its syntactic features,” similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain.
For example, some blues rock songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation.
''The Voice'' is another well known singing competition program.
Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register or a vocal resonance area.
Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another.
that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments.
Singing may positively influence the immune system through the reduction of stress.
The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx.
A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm.
The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the Singer's Formant; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the ear's frequency range.
Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.
When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, treble, can be applied.
Church choir soloists can make from $30 to $500 per performance (all figures in US dollars).
Other well known singing competitions include ''The X Factor'', ''America's Got Talent'', ''Rising Star'', and ''The Sing-Off''.
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations.
Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.
Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists.
# Head facing straight forward
The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing.
The term "register" can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the voice.
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place.
Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia.
Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,  because the process of studying singing does not end after an initial diploma or degree is finished-even decades after finishing their initial training, professional singers continue to seek out vocal coaching to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles.
All musical cultures have some form of vocal music and there are many long standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.
Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.
Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass.
An exception is five-part gospel a cappella music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a descant, and not the melody.
Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone.
It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes.
Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music.
At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to learn their songs, to improvise and even to compose new melodies.
However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing.
Currently there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing.
In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing.
For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head.
The terms were later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio and head registers.
Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins.
This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.
Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include vocal coaches, choral directors, vocal music educators, opera directors, and other teachers of singing.
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.
In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.
One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a microphone and PA system (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house.
Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that “music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication” and that “singing.
**Breathing and air support for singing
In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.
#The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.
Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination.
Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration.
* A phonatory process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes.
Classical concert soloists, for which the number of job openings is very limited, have approximate earnings of $350 per performance and up.
Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass.
College or university degrees are "not always required but the equivalent training is usually necessary".
As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.
Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture.
Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc.
The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms.
Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.
For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.
#Sound is initiated in the larynx
In linguistics, a '''register language''' is a language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system.
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.
The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body.
Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the modal register.
Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor.
Opera soloists, for which the number of job openings is very limited, can make from $350 to $20,000 per performance for the most elite performers.
Once aspiring vocalists have completed their professional training, they must then take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing auditions in front of an opera director, choirmaster, music theatre director or conductor.
A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside.
The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre.
A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist'''.
With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function.
Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.
