In effect, Dido's violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the
Virgil's Latin has been praised for its evenness, subtlety and dignity.
While releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence, her last words
In the United States, Virgil and specifically the ''Aeneid'' were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s; the current (2011) Advanced Placement curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: "The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student's ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the ''Aeneid'' that appear on the course syllabus in Latin."
The Trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls, and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged from it, opening the city's gates to allow the returned Greek army to slaughter the Trojans.
Neptune takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno's intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds wouldn't bother him again, lest they be punished harsher than they were this time.
Aeneas's leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted: One suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which Aeneas returned to the world of the living; another is that it implies that all of Aeneas's actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow "false".
And from your criminal blood exacts his due.
The ''Aeneid'' was seen as reflecting this aim, by depicting the heroic Aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence, rather than personal gains, and going off on a journey for the betterment of Rome.
Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, Ascanius, and father, Anchises, after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius' head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star).

Disguised as such, Cupid goes to Dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest.
In book 11, another notable, Camilla, a sort of Amazon character, fights bravely but is killed.

She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child.
Other scholars claim that Virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene (an apparent system of reincarnation) are not to be taken as literal.
It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter.
The ''Aeneid'' is a cornerstone of the Western canon, and early (at least by the 2nd century AD) became one of the essential elements of a Latin education, usually required to be memorized.
As was the rule in classical antiquity, an author's style was seen as an expression of his personality and character.
In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas's men as a sacrifice: Palinurus, who steers Aeneas's ship by night, falls overboard.
In Book 6, Aeneas, with the guidance of the Cumaean Sibyl, descends into the underworld through an opening at Cumae; there he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.

In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets Andromache, the widow of Hector.
Furthermore, he uses personification, metaphor and simile in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene.
I'd lead them to by sea.
In addition, the ''Aeneid'' gives mythic legitimization to the rule of Julius Caesar and, by extension, to his adopted son Augustus, by immortalizing the tradition that renamed Aeneas's son, Ascanius (called Ilus from ''Ilium'', meaning Troy), ''Iulus'', thus making him an ancestor of the ''gens Julia'', the family of Julius Caesar, and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the Underworld.
Despite the polished and complex nature of the ''Aeneid'' (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work.
One example is from Aeneas's reaction to a painting of the sack of Troy: ''Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt''—"These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart" (''Aeneid'' I, 462).
In the ensuing battles, Turnus
A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas.

According to tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece around 19 BC to revise the ''Aeneid''.
Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the judgment of Paris, and because her favorite city, Carthage, will be destroyed by Aeneas's descendants.
Some legends state that Virgil, fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, Augustus) that the ''Aeneid'' should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which Venus and Vulcan have sexual intercourse, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues.
of Rome and new levels of prosperity.
Gathered for exile, young-pitiful people
Finally, when Aeneas arrives in Latium, conflict inevitably arises.
In Latin-Christian culture, the ''Aeneid'' was one of the canonical texts, subjected to commentary as a philological and educational study, with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus.
In an extension of the latter interpretation, it has been suggested that Virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of Rome is but a lie.
Soon they come ashore at the land of the Cyclops.
The ''Aeneid'', like other classical epics, is written in dactylic hexameter: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables).
A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem.
Make this your offering to my dust.
The perceived deficiency of any account of Aeneas's marriage to Lavinia or his founding of the Roman race led some writers, such as the 15th-century Italian poet Maffeo Vegio (through his ''Mapheus Vegius'' widely printed in the Renaissance), Pier Candido Decembrio (whose attempt was never completed), Claudio Salvucci (in his 1994 epic poem ''The Laviniad''), and Ursula K. Le Guin (in her 2008 novel ''Lavinia'') to compose their own supplements.
He tells of how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace, where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, Polydorus; The Strophades, where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno; Crete, which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city, which they name Pergamea (but they are set straight by Apollo); and Buthrotum.

Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas's mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy.
Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity).

Aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city.
Although Turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter,
The '''''Aeneid''''' (;  ) is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans.
Juno proceeds to Aeolus, King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe (Deiopea, the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife).
The ''Aeneid'' potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under Augustus, or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future.
Juno is heavily involved in bringing about this war—she has persuaded the Queen of Latium to demand that Lavinia be married to Turnus, the ruler of a local people, the Rutuli.

Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the ''Aeneid'' is more complete than most classical epics.
This section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas who symbolizes ''pietas'' (reason) in a moment becomes ''furor'' (fury), thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself.
However, the new emperor, Augustus Caesar, began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace, specifically through the re-introduction of traditional Roman moral values.
The ''Aeneid'' appears to have been a great success.

There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of Priam's sons, who has the gift of prophecy.
The first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an Anglic language is the Scots translation by Gavin Douglas—his ''Eneados'', completed in 1513, which also included Maffeo Vegio's supplement.
Turnus's strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock, and he is struck in the leg by Aeneas's spear.
In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing for antagonism even after foul play.
In the musical ''Spring Awakening'', based on the play of the same title by Frank Wedekind, schoolboys study the Latin text, and the first verse of Book 1 is incorporated into the number "All That's Known".

This act of violence causes Aeneas to be consumed with fury.
Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a cave in which Aeneas and Dido presumably have sex, an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them.
Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard that wish, instead ordering the ''Aeneid'' to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.

As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas's emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the "pious" and "righteous" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.

With her motherly love revived in the presence of the boy, Dido's heart is pierced and she falls in love with both the boy and his father.
As a result, the existing text of the ''Aeneid'' may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication.
They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus.
A seventeenth century popular broadside ballad also appears to recount events from books 1-4 of the ''Aeneid,'' focusing mostly on the relationship between Aeneas and Dido.

later relationship between Carthage and Rome.
In a dream, Hector, the fallen Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family.

Most classic translations, including both Douglas and Dryden, employed a rhyme scheme, a very non-Roman convention that is not usually followed in modern versions.
It has been foretold that in Italy, he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations.
Of whom so often you have heard the promise,
Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous ''pietas'', and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.
His progeny and all his race to come:
Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as ''Ausonia'' or ''Hesperia''), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world.
An example of a simile can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him.
After fleeing Troy, he goes back for his wife, Creusa, but she has been killed.
Dido kills herself in an excessively violent way over a pyre in order to end and escape her worldly problem: being heartbroken

The Aeneid comes to an abrupt ending, and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he was able to finish the poem.

An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome's future, which he will do in Book 6.
''Blazing up and terrible in his anger'', he called out: "You in your plunder, torn from one of mine, shall I be robbed of you?
golden reign of Augustus.
The ballad, "The Wandering Prince of Troy", presents many similar elements as Virgil's epic, but alters Dido's final sentiments toward Aeneas, as well as presents an interesting end for Aeneas himself.
This is, however, a rough correspondence, the limitations of which should be borne in mind.
He meets King Evander of Arcadia, whose son Pallas agrees to lead troops against the other Italians.
With their belongings, for whatever lands
This wound will come from Pallas: Pallas makes this offering, and from your criminal blood exacts his due."
This parallel functions as propaganda in support of Augustus, as it depicts the Trojan people,
However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e., not a complete line of dactylic hexameter).
Also in the manner of Homer, the story proper begins in medias res (in the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, heading in the direction of Italy.
Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome.
The influence is also visible in very modern work: Brian Friel's ''Translations'' (a play written in the 1980s, set in 19th century Ireland), makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the ''Aeneid'':
This is one of the first examples of how violence begets violence: even though the Trojans know they have lost the battle, they continue to fight for their country.
to Augustus as in other parts of the poem, Virgil outright praises the emperor in Book 6, referring to Augustus as a harbinger for the glory
But when Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty, he has no choice but to part.
The Italian poet Dante Alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the ''Aeneid'', so much so that his magnum opus ''The Divine Comedy'', itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the ''Aeneid'' and features the author Virgil as a major character – the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio.
Then, O my Tyrians, besiege with hate
The strong influence of the ''Aeneid'' has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures—some English works that show its influence being ''Beowulf'', Layamon's ''Brut'' (through the source text ''Historia Regum Britanniae''), ''The Faerie Queene'', and Milton's ''Paradise Lost''.
This violence continues as Aeneas makes his journey.
Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that the location of the two passages, at the very end of the so-called Volume I (Books 1–6, the ''Odyssey''), and Volume II (Books 7–12, the ''Iliad''), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.
and her people's only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for Aeneas and his Trojans.
This final act of violence shows how Turnus' violence—the act of killing Pallas—inevitably leads to more violence and his own death.

The fleet, led by Aeneas, is on a voyage to find a second home.
For when the sight came home to him, Aeneas ''raged'' at the relic of his anguish worn by this man as trophy.
As with other classical Latin poetry, the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important.
Aeneas and his men have left Carthage for Sicily, where Aeneas organizes celebratory games—a boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest.
The gates, however, are defended until Aeneas returns with his Tuscan and Arcadian reinforcements.
