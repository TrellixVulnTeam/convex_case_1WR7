They left Bermuda for Nassau on the Canadian steamship ''Lady Somers'' on 15 August, arriving two days later.
# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents.
Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch.
In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht ''Nahlin''.
In 1920, he wrote of Indigenous Australians "they are the most revolting form of living creatures I've ever seen
Edward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria.
Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, ''A Family Album'', chiefly about the fashion and habits of the Royal Family throughout his life, from the time of Queen Victoria to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.
Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style ''Her Royal Highness''; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as "Mr Edward Windsor".
Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but his father disagreed.
Lord Caldecote wrote a warning to Winston Churchill: "the Duke is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue."
The Allies became sufficiently disturbed by German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941.
The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another.
There is no land whose people want war."
In 1967, they joined the Royal Family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth.
With a reign of 326 days, Edward was one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.
His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.
After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France.
Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare first-hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916.
Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: "To give up all this for that", she said.
The royalties from the book added to their income.
He had joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured by the enemy.
His comment during a tour of depressed villages in South Wales that "something must be done" for the unemployed coal miners was seen as an attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind.
The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France.
If he had stayed, everything would have been different.
Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, which at the time opposed the remarriage of divorced people if their former spouses were still alive.
Under the code name Operation Willi, Nazi agents, principally Walter Schellenberg, plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal and return to Spain, kidnapping him if necessary.
The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France.
Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.
On 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, George VI announced he was to make his brother the "Duke of Windsor" with the style of ''Royal Highness''.
By October it was becoming clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at Ipswich Assizes.
Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the traditional religious location of Westminster Abbey, but in the Banqueting House in Whitehall.
The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire.
His father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra).
Of Hitler he wrote: "the Führer struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions."
The Duke protested that he had been misquoted and misinterpreted.
In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, ''A King's Story'', in which he expresses disagreement with liberal politics.
He was taught German and French by private tutors.
His attitudes towards many of the Empire's subjects and various foreign peoples, both during his time as Prince of Wales and later as Duke of Windsor, were little commented upon at the time, but have soured his reputation subsequently.
On 28&nbsp;May 1972, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th&nbsp;birthday.
He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as midshipman for three months aboard the battleship ''Hindustan'', then immediately entered Magdalen College, Oxford, for which, in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually.
She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne.
In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather and father.
The couple doted on the pug dogs they kept.
He showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions.
The funeral service was held in the chapel on 5&nbsp;June in the presence of the Queen, the Royal Family, and the Duchess of Windsor, who stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit.
The prospect of having an American divorcee with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.
He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, replying that Prince Charles would not want his "aged great-uncle" there.

He said of Étienne Dupuch, the editor of the ''Nassau Daily Tribune'': "It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium."
Churchill threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.
In July 1940, Edward was appointed Governor of the Bahamas.
When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted.
Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested.
I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind.
In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.

King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.
Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935, they later refused to receive her.
Letters Patent dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the "title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness" upon the Duke of Windsor, but specifically stated that "his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute".
During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes; they did so.
George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.
Edward's affair with an American divorcee led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who examined in secret the nature of their relationship.
The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria for her late husband Albert, Prince Consort, and the last four names – George, Andrew, Patrick and David – came from the Patron Saints of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.
At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that "a foreign power" had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed MI5 of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits.
The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.
Choosing not to end the relationship, Edward abdicated.
On 14 April 1937, Attorney General Sir Donald Somervell submitted to Home Secretary Sir John Simon a memorandum summarising the views of Lord Advocate T. M. Cooper, Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:
One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents.
The French government exempted him from paying income tax, and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary.
As was common practice with upper-class children of the time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents.
Edward duly signed the instruments of abdication at Fort Belvedere on 10 December 1936 in the presence of his younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York, next in line for the throne; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent.
Queen Mary refused to receive her formally.
His abdication was a severe loss for us."
Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father.
A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the university club.
Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907.
In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy.
Frail, and suffering increasingly from dementia, the Duchess died 14&nbsp;years later, and was buried alongside her husband.
After the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi.
After his abdication, he was created Duke of Windsor.
The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that the people would never accept a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands as queen consort.
Edward's womanising and reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, King George V, and those close to the prince.
They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; Gore Vidal, who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation.
As required by the Statute of Westminster, all the Dominions consented to the abdication.
In the view of historians such as Philip Williamson, the popular perception today that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false, and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable.
To modern sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while married to Simpson "seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation" for his abdication.
Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare.
He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.
The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance.
On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, explained his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast.
The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI.
The Duke and Duchess settled in France.
When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection.
Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.
The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace in the company of the then still-married Simpson.
The former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.
That year, they were invited as guests of honour to a dinner at the White House by President Richard Nixon.
Later that year, the couple toured Germany.
He was baptised Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894 by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury.
Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.
Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war.
The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.
Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later.
The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, whom American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring.
A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.
In February 1940, the German ambassador in The Hague, Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium, which the Duke later denied.
When the First World War broke out in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.
His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention, and at the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time.
His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away.
Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, in 1927.
The Prince wished the Exhibition to include "a great national sports ground", and so played a part in the creation of Wembley Stadium.
During the Second World War, he was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France but, after private accusations that he held Nazi sympathies, he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas.
The Duke did not enjoy being governor, and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".
Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: "your last letter destroyed the last vestige of feeling I had left for you&nbsp;... and has made further normal correspondence between us impossible."
The Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons), Canada (Mackenzie King) and South Africa (J.
Throughout the 1920s, Edward, as Prince of Wales, represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions.
Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.
George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became first in the line of succession, as heiress presumptive.
After his abdication, he used the arms again differenced by a label of three points argent, but this time with the centre point bearing an imperial crown.
The denial of the style ''Royal Highness'' to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement.
The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America.
Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.
There, Edward continued his relationships with a series of married women, including Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American Wallis Simpson.
His body was returned to Britain, lying in state at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
He left Oxford after eight terms without any academic qualifications.
He resigned the post on 16 March 1945.
He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – communists" and "men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft".
Author Charles Higham claimed that Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent, acting on orders from the British Royal Family, made a successful secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany towards the end of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.
In May 1939, the Duke was commissioned by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the battlefields of Verdun.
The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the American Export Lines steamship ''Excalibur'', which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to New York City so that they could be dropped off at Bermuda on the 9th.
The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.
George V was disappointed by Edward's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and was reluctant to see him inherit the Crown.
It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it.
Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.
On 16 July 1936, an Irish fraudster called Jerome Bannigan, alias George Andrew McMahon, produced a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace.
At the end of the war, the couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas.
In 1965, the Duke and Duchess returned to London.
It is now thought that Bannigan had indeed been in contact with MI5, but the veracity of the remainder of his claims remains open.
In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.
He also visited the poverty-stricken areas of the country, and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the Empire between 1919 and 1935.
In 1930, George V gave Edward the lease of Fort Belvedere, in Windsor Great Park.
Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second.
Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.
It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis.
The visit was much publicised by the German media.
His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI.
Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: "I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved.
In 1940 he said: "In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society&nbsp;... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganisation of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly."
When Germany invaded the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to Biarritz, then in June to Spain.
He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary).
Edward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at Caernarvon Castle on 13 July 1911.
Edward proposed an alternative solution of a morganatic marriage, in which he would remain king but Simpson would not become queen.
The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government.
Edward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until nearly 13.
In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to "precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini&nbsp;... that's what Eden did, he helped to bring on the war&nbsp;... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews".
Preparations for all contingencies were made, including the prospect of the coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis.
# We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness.
Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors in 1972 while on a state visit to France; however, only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall.
George V favoured his son Albert ("Bertie"), and granddaughter Elizabeth ("Lilibet"), and told a courtier, "I pray to God that my eldest son Edward will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."
Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.
As Sovereign, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.
A course of two years followed by entry into the Royal Navy was planned.
Relations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the Royal Family were strained for decades.
He famously said, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."
Initially Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka.
An undated report detailed a visit by the couple to an antique shop, where the proprietor later noted "that the lady seemed to have POW Prince of Wales completely under her thumb."
In December 1964, he was operated on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina in his left eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder.
The new king, George VI, forbade members of the Royal Family to attend to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
Edward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the coinage that bore his image.
She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French master, and encouraged them to confide in her.
He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the opposite direction to his or her predecessor.
He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Frogmore.
The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for "intent to alarm".
He was created Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king.
# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis.
The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.
Edward was the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary.
Until a 1965 agreement with Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II, the Duke and Duchess had planned for a burial in a cemetery plot they had purchased at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, where the Duchess's father was interred.
"After I am dead," George said, "the boy will ruin himself in 12 months."
His mother was the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck (Francis and Mary Adelaide).
Alan Lascelles, Edward's private secretary for eight years during this period, believed that "for some hereditary or physiological reason his normal mental development stopped dead when he reached adolescence".
According to the Duke of Windsor himself, the experience of "the unending scenes of horror" during the First World War led him to support appeasement.
When his father ascended the throne on 6 May 1910, following the death of Edward VII, Edward automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and he was created Prince of Wales a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday.
He chose to abdicate.
During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor.
On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry.
The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine side of the Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent.
In 1929, ''Time'' magazine reported that Edward teased his sister-in-law, Elizabeth, the wife of his younger brother Albert, by calling her "Queen Elizabeth".
The magazine asked if "she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V – which would make her nickname come true".
What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria.
During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes.
He took a particular interest in science and in 1926 was  president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when his alma mater, Oxford University, hosted the society's annual general meeting.
It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings.
In December 1940, the Duke gave Fulton Oursler of ''Liberty'' magazine an interview at Government House in Nassau.
A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service.
In June 1953, instead of attending the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris.
