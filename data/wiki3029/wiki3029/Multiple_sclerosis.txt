Overall, it has been estimated that HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition.
# secondary progressive (SPMS)
Almost 40% of people with MS reach the seventh decade of life.
This is the least common of all subtypes.
On the other hand, the term ''malignant multiple sclerosis'' is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period.
Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults.
Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease.
Evidence for a virus as a cause include: the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infection.
Related to these investigations is the development of a test for JC virus antibodies, which might help to determine who is at greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab.
Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, and acupuncture.
There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.
The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials.
The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.
During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.
It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements.
MS is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system.
Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes.
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system.
Similarly, studies aimed to improve the efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies are occurring.
The blood–brain barrier is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system.
Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS.
In 2013, about 2.3 million people were affected globally with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations.
Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons.
These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.
The McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance.
In Africa rates are less than 0.5 per 100,000, while they are 2.8 per 100,000 in South East Asia, 8.3 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 80 per 100,000 in Europe.

He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media the "liberation procedure" to correct it, and claimed that 73% of participants improved.
Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system.
Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease.
This could indicate that there are a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences.
In this population tentative evidence supports mitoxantrone moderately slowing the progression of the disease and decreasing rates of relapses over two years.
Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis.
Both cases have led to the proposal of a "Viking gene" hypothesis for the dissemination of the disease.
Robert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.
His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) after the funeral of a friend.
The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents.
Stress may be a risk factor although the evidence to support this is weak.
There have been several trials of combined therapy, yet none have shown positive enough results to be considered as a useful treatment for MS.
It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria.
A number of lesion patterns have been described.
Concerns have been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and its assumptions about the underlying cause of the disease are not backed by known data.
A young woman called Halldora who lived in Iceland around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after.
The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.
It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.
T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the blood–brain barrier.
Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.
Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain.
The disease-modifying treatments have several adverse effects.
The average life expectancy is 30 years from the start of the disease, which is 5 to 10 years less than that of unaffected people.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques).
Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop.
There is debate on whether they are MS variants or different diseases.
The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.
When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals.
The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related.
The primary progressive subtype occurs in approximately 10–20% of individuals, with no remission after the initial symptoms.
Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems.
Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs.
This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the breakdown of the axons of neurons.
In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings.
Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed.
Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination.
While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.
Several phenotypes (commonly named types), or patterns of progression, have been described.
This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS.
These techniques are more specific for the disease than existing ones, but still lack some standardization of acquisition protocols and the creation of normative values.
Rates surpass 200 per 100,000 in certain populations of Northern European descent.
Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease.
A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath.
Association with occupational exposures and toxins—mainly solvents—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached.
The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype.
MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist.
While the cause is not clear, the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells.
The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS.
His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948.
Research on neuroprotection and regenerative treatments, such as stem cell therapy, while of high importance, are in the early stages.
Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation.
In RRMS they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks.
Request for approval of ''peginterferon beta-1a'' is expected during 2013.
The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%.
Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer.
MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot.
MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.
There are other techniques under development that include contrast agents capable of measuring levels of peripheral macrophages, inflammation, or neuronal dysfunction, and techniques that measure iron deposition that could serve to determine the role of this feature in MS, or that of cerebral perfusion.
Fingolimod may give rise to hypertension and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels.
His diary was published in 1919 as ''The Journal of a Disappointed Man''.
Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.
If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population.
Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS.
Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning.
These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques.
In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair.
Secondary progressive MS occurs in around 65% of those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission.
These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles.
The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10-15% of cases).
Progressive relapsing MS describes those individuals who, from onset, have a steady neurologic decline but also have clear superimposed attacks.
In May 2016 the FDA approved daclizumab for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults, with requirements for postmarketing studies and submission of a formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.
Stress may also trigger an attack.
Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation.
As of 2016, nine disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) including: interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate and alemtuzumab.
Nevertheless, two-thirds of the deaths are directly related to the consequences of the disease.
Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels.
# progressive relapsing (PRMS).
A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.
During the 2000s and 2010s, there has been approval of several oral drugs that are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use.
Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination.
The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.
The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability.
Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.
Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.
The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways.
Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful.
Smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for MS.
Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases.
Medications used to treat MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated.
Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.
Although most people lose the ability to walk before death, 90% are capable of independent walking at 10 years from onset, and 75% at 15 years.
The main rationale for using a number of medications in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms and, therefore, their use is not necessarily exclusive.
They are important not only for prognosis but also for treatment decisions.
Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; however, most studies show no association.
In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis.
In 1996, the United States National Multiple Sclerosis Society described four clinical courses.
Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.
Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing.
MS is more common in regions with northern European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations.
In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the numerous scars (sclerae—better known as plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.
The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent.
This entity was removed in the 2013 review.
The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others.
The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents.
Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.
Although, in general, effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.
During the 20th century theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in the 1990s.
Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, tend to be more disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.
To be specific, MS involves the loss of oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials).
The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).
Over 50% of people with MS may use complementary and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined.
No treatment has been shown to change the course of primary progressive MS and as of 2011 only one medication, mitoxantrone, has been approved for secondary progressive MS.
As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several adverse effects.
The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons.
Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age.
There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis.
Saint Lidwina of Schiedam (1380–1433), a Dutch nun, may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she had intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss&mdash;symptoms typical of MS.
During his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and erectile dysfunction.
30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.
Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease.
While monoclonal antibodies will probably have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated with them.
Specific genes that have been linked with MS include differences in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 that serves as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
In 2008, vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves narrowing of the veins draining the brain, which he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI).
Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes.
Several promising approaches have been proposed including: interleukin-6, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, osteopontin, and fetuin-A.
Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level.
As of 2010, the number of people with MS was 2–2.5&nbsp;million (approximately 30 per 100,000) globally, with rates varying widely in different regions.
Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.
At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis.
This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown.
The condition begins in 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties.
Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability.
Unusual types of MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis.
The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks.
It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.
Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing.
The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms.
If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country.
Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance.
Also, further studies have either not found a similar relationship or found one that is much less strong, raising serious objections to the hypothesis.
Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year.
There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.
Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS.
Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation.
Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed.
Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.
Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways.
This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.
That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, the most important of which being opportunistic infections.
This includes the use of new preparations such as the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, which it is hoped may be given at less frequent doses with similar effects.
Many people pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence.
'''Multiple sclerosis''' ('''MS''') is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged.
Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system.
Improvement in neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carry a promise for better diagnosis and prognosis predictions, although the effect of such improvements in daily medical practice may take several decades.
MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).
Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocyte that plays an important role in the body's defenses.
Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage.
While dimethyl fumarate may lead to a reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.
Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease.
This theory received significant attention in the media and among those with MS, especially in Canada.
Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins.
MS usually appears in adults in their late twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in childhood and after 50 years of age.
Other effects include looking for biomarkers that distinguish between those who will and will not respond to medications.
Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear.
Phenotypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course.
Alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments.
Studies on populational and geographical patterns have been common and have led to a number of theories about the cause.
That year about 20,000 people died from MS, up from 12,000 in 1990.
In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis.
