At his request, Raphael was buried in the Pantheon.
In the following years he painted works for other churches there, including the ''Mond Crucifixion'' (about 1503) and the Brera ''Wedding of the Virgin'' (1504), and for Perugia, such as the ''Oddi Altarpiece''.
But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506.
He produced a number of significant altarpieces, including ''The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia'' and the ''Sistine Madonna''.

These very large and complex compositions have been regarded ever since as among the supreme works of the grand manner of the High Renaissance, and the "classic art" of the post-antique West.
The death of Julius in 1513 did not interrupt the work at all, as he was succeeded by Raphael's last Pope, the Medici Pope Leo X, with whom Raphael formed an even closer relationship, and who continued to commission him.
He designed several other buildings, and for a short time was the most important architect in Rome, working for a small circle around the Papacy.
Evangelista da Pian di Meleto, who had worked for his father, was also named in the commission.
And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second.
The printmakers and architects in Raphael's circle are discussed below.
An important building, the Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila for Leo's Papal Chamberlain Giovanni Battista Branconio, was completely destroyed to make way for Bernini's ''piazza'' for St. Peter's, but drawings of the façade and courtyard remain.
Penni did not achieve a personal reputation equal to Giulio's, as after Raphael's death he became Giulio's less-than-equal collaborator in turn for much of his subsequent career.
This was arguably the largest workshop team assembled under any single old master painter, and much higher than the norm.
Raphael's friend Cardinal Bibbiena was also one of Leo's old tutors, and a close friend and advisor.
Those, like Dolce and Aretino, who held this view were usually the survivors of Renaissance Humanism, unable to follow Michelangelo as he moved on into Mannerism.
Other rulers pressed for work, and King Francis I of France was sent two paintings as diplomatic gifts from the Pope.
File:Giulio Romano 001.jpg|''The Fire in the Borgo'', 1514, Stanza dell'incendio del Borgo, painted by the workshop to Raphael's design
However though both Penni and Giulio were sufficiently skilled that distinguishing between their hands and that of Raphael himself is still sometimes difficult, there is no doubt that many of Raphael's later wall-paintings, and probably some of his easel paintings, are more notable for their design than their execution.
His interest was unusual in such a major artist; from his contemporaries it was only shared by Titian, who had worked much less successfully with Raimondi.
The reputation of the court had been established by Federico III da Montefeltro, a highly successful condottiere who had been created Duke of Urbino by the Pope - Urbino formed part of the Papal States - and who died the year before Raphael was born.
A brilliant self-portrait drawing from his teenage years shows his precocious talent.
His palette was rich and he used almost all of the then available pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, verdigris and ochres.
His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates.
In his final years he was one of the first artists to use female models for preparatory drawings—male pupils ("garzoni") were normally used for studies of both sexes.
He also made unusually extensive use, on both paper and plaster, of a "blind stylus", scratching lines which leave only an indentation, but no mark.
Raphael would have been aware of his works in Florence, but in his most original work of these years, he strikes out in a different direction.
Whatever the cause, in his acute illness, which lasted fifteen days, Raphael was composed enough to confess his sins, receive the last rites, and to put his affairs in order.
His period of greatest influence was from the late 17th to late 19th centuries, when his perfect decorum and balance were greatly admired.
He also designed and painted the ''Loggie'' at the Vatican, a long thin gallery then open to a courtyard on one side, decorated with Roman-style grottesche.
Among prints of the paintings ''The Parnassus'' (with considerable differences) and ''Galatea'' were also especially well-known.
Giovanni da Udine had a more independent status, and was responsible for the decorative stucco work and grotesques surrounding the main frescoes.
Another building, for Pope Leo's doctor, the ''Palazzo di Jacobo da Brescia'', was moved in the 1930s but survives; this was designed to complement a palace on the same street by Bramante, where Raphael himself lived for a time.
He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking.
From 1517 Raphael lived in the Palazzo Caprini in the Borgo, in rather grand style in a palace designed by Bramante.
He was made a "Groom of the Chamber" of the Pope, which gave him status at court and an additional income, and also a knight of the Papal Order of the Golden Spur.
He became close to other regular visitors to the court: Pietro Bibbiena and Pietro Bembo, both later cardinals, were already becoming well known as writers, and would be in Rome during Raphael's period there.
Mannerism, beginning at the time of his death, and later the Baroque, took art "in a direction totally opposed" to Raphael's qualities; "with Raphael's death, classic art &ndash; the High Renaissance &ndash; subsided", as Walter Friedländer put it.
The Perugino workshop was active in both Perugia and Florence, perhaps maintaining two permanent branches.

Other figures in that and later paintings in the room show the same influences, but as still cohesive with a development of Raphael's own style.
He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been "a great help to his father".
His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur.
Michelangelo already disliked Leonardo, and in Rome came to dislike Raphael even more, attributing conspiracies against him to the younger man.
In Germany Raphael had an immense influence on religious art of the Nazarene movement and Düsseldorf school of painting in the 19th century.
For John Shearman, Raphael's art marks "a shift of resources away from production to research and development".
One of the first and clearest instances was the portrait in ''The School of Athens'' of Michelangelo himself, as Heraclitus, which seems to draw clearly from the Sybils and ''ignudi'' of the Sistine ceiling.
Michelangelo, meanwhile, had been commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says was a friend of Raphael.
Sir Joshua Reynolds in his ''Discourses'' praised his "simple, grave, and majestic dignity" and said he "stands in general foremost of the first i.e., best painters", especially for his frescoes (in which he included the "Raphael Cartoons"), whereas "Michael Angelo claims the next attention.
He was soon seen as the ideal model by those disliking the excesses of Mannerism:the opinion ...was generally held in the middle of the sixteenth century that Raphael was the ideal balanced painter, universal in his talent, satisfying all the absolute standards, and obeying all the rules which were supposed to govern the arts, whereas Michelangelo was the eccentric genius, more brilliant than any other artists in his particular field, the drawing of the male nude, but unbalanced and lacking in certain qualities, such as grace and restraint, essential to the great artist.
The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.
His funeral was extremely grand, attended by large crowds.
But most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is very clear: "probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master's teaching as Raphael did", according to Wölfflin.
He dictated his will, in which he left sufficient funds for his mistress's care, entrusted to his loyal servant Baviera, and left most of his studio contents to Giulio Romano and Penni.
The best known work is ''The School of Athens'' in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura.

Raphael made no prints himself, but entered into a collaboration with Marcantonio Raimondi to produce engravings to Raphael's designs, which created many of the most famous Italian prints of the century, and was important in the rise of the reproductive print.
The Vatican projects took most of his time, although he painted several portraits, including those of his two main patrons, the popes Julius II and his successor Leo X, the former considered one of his finest.
It is possible that Raphael saw the finished series before his death—they were probably completed in 1520.
Raphael was clearly influenced by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling in the course of painting the room.
The reaction of other artists to the daunting force of Michelangelo was the dominating question in Italian art for the following few decades, and Raphael, who had already shown his gift for absorbing influences into his own personal style, rose to the challenge perhaps better than any other artist.
Federico was succeeded by his son Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, who married Elisabetta Gonzaga, daughter of the ruler of Mantua, the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts.
He is said to have had many affairs, but a permanent fixture in his life in Rome was "La Fornarina", Margherita Luti, the daughter of a baker (''fornaro'') named Francesco Luti from Siena who lived at Via del Governo Vecchio.
He never married, but in 1514 became engaged to Maria Bibbiena, Cardinal Medici Bibbiena's niece; he seems to have been talked into this by his friend the Cardinal, and his lack of enthusiasm seems to be shown by the marriage not having taken place before she died in 1520.
Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.
These are large works, some in fresco, where Raphael confidently marshals his compositions in the somewhat static style of Perugino.
File:Raffaello, pala baglioni, deposizione.jpg|''Deposition of Christ'', 1507, drawing from Roman sarcophagi
One of his most important papal commissions was the Raphael Cartoons (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum), a series of 10 cartoons, of which seven survive, for tapestries with scenes of the lives of Saint Paul and Saint Peter, for the Sistine Chapel.
Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence.
Nobody excelled him in that judgment, with which he united to his own observations on nature the energy of Michael Angelo, and the beauty and simplicity of the antique.
The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source, and has been disputed—eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin.
In later works painted by the workshop, the drawings are often painfully more attractive than the paintings.

He was invited by the new Pope Julius II, perhaps at the suggestion of his architect Donato Bramante, then engaged on St. Peter's, who came from just outside Urbino and was distantly related to Raphael.
He also designed some of the decoration for the Villa Madama, the work in both villas being executed by his workshop.
According to Vasari, his father placed him in the workshop of the Umbrian master Pietro Perugino as an apprentice "despite the tears of his mother".
He very probably also visited Florence in this period.
The façade was an unusually richly decorated one for the period, including both painted panels on the top story (of three), and much sculpture on the middle one.
He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo.
We have very little evidence of the internal working arrangements of the workshop, apart from the works of art themselves, often very difficult to assign to a particular hand.
Unlike Michelangelo, who had been kept hanging around in Rome for several months after his first summons, Raphael was immediately commissioned by Julius to fresco what was intended to become the Pope's private library at the Vatican Palace.
In mediæval art, thought is the first thing, execution the second; in modern art execution is the first thing, and thought the second.
Raphael was then given further rooms to paint, displacing other artists including Perugino and Signorelli.
An alternative theory is that he received at least some training from Timoteo Viti, who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495.
He probably continued to live with his stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master.
File:Galatea (engraving).jpg|Galatea, engraving after the fresco in the Villa Farnesina
Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal ''Holy Family'', was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings.
His classicism would later take a less literal direction.
Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture.
Leonardo was more than thirty years older than Raphael, but Michelangelo, who was in Rome for this period, was just eight years his senior.
To the question, therefore, which ought to hold the first rank, Raffaelle or Michael Angelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but Raffaelle is the first.
File:Baldassare Castiglione, by Raffaello Sanzio, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|''Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione'', c. 1515
Perino del Vaga, already a master, and Polidoro da Caravaggio, who was supposedly promoted from a labourer carrying building materials on the site, also became notable painters in their own right.
Outside Italy, reproductive prints by Raimondi and others were the main way that Raphael's art was experienced until the twentieth century.
His ''Deposition of Christ'' draws on classical sarcophagi to spread the figures across the front of the picture space in a complex and not wholly successful arrangement.
Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an oil varnish medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas.
Vasari wrote that it was impossible to distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern art historians claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop.
Baviero Carocci, called "Il Baviera" by Vasari, an assistant who Raphael evidently trusted with his money, ended up in control of most of the copper plates after Raphael's death, and had a successful career in the new occupation of a publisher of prints.
He was seen as the best model for the history painting, regarded as the highest in the hierarchy of genres.
File:Raffaello, studi per madonne col bambino.jpg|Developing the composition for a ''Madonna and Child''
File:Raphael Spasimo.jpg|''Il Spasimo'' 1517, brings a new degree of expressiveness to his art.
Vasari emphasises that Raphael ran a very harmonious and efficient workshop, and had extraordinary skill in smoothing over troubles and arguments with both patrons and his assistants—a contrast with the stormy pattern of Michelangelo's relationships with both.
Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career.
He completed a sequence of three rooms, each with paintings on each wall and often the ceilings too, increasingly leaving the work of painting from his detailed drawings to the large and skilled workshop team he had acquired, who added a fourth room, probably only including some elements designed by Raphael, after his early death in 1520.
The inscription in his marble sarcophagus, an elegiac distich written by Pietro Bembo, reads: "Ille hic est Raffael, timuit quo sospite vinci, rerum magna parens et moriente mori", meaning: "Here lies that famous Raphael by whom Nature feared to be conquered while he lived, and when he was dying, feared herself to die."
Julius had made changes to the street plan of Rome, creating several new thoroughfares, and he wanted them filled with splendid palaces.
Only some floor-plans remain for a large palace planned for himself on the new via Giulia in the rione of Regola, for which he was accumulating the land in his last years.
Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career.
The emphasis of Federico's court was rather more literary than artistic, but Giovanni Santi was a poet of sorts as well as a painter, and had written a rhymed chronicle of the life of Federico, and both wrote the texts and produced the decor for masque-like court entertainments.
It would perhaps have resembled the temple in the background of ''The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple''.
He was evidently already much in demand even at this early stage in his career.
The most important figures were Giulio Romano, a young pupil from Rome (only about twenty-one at Raphael's death), and Gianfrancesco Penni, already a Florentine master.
Raphael's compositions were always admired and studied, and became the cornerstone of the training of the Academies of art.
He was one of the last artists to use metalpoint (literally a sharp pointed piece of silver or another metal) extensively, although he also made superb use of the freer medium of red or black chalk.
Reynolds was less enthusiastic about Raphael's panel paintings, but the slight sentimentality of these made them enormously popular in the 19th century: "We have been familiar with them from childhood onwards, through a far greater mass of reproductions than any other artist in the world has ever had..." wrote Wölfflin, who was born in 1862, of Raphael's Madonnas.
It appears his designs would have made the church a good deal gloomier than the final design, with massive piers all the way down the nave, "like an alley" according to a critical posthumous analysis by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger.
According to a critic whose ideas greatly influenced them, John Ruskin:
wrote another writer after his death.
Michael'', and he began to paint Madonnas and portraits.
File:Raphael missing.jpg|''Portrait of a Young Man'', 1514, Lost during Second World War.
It was commissioned in 1500 and finished in 1501; now only some cut sections and a preparatory drawing remain.
Pray note them clearly.
The main designs for the Villa Farnesina were not by Raphael, but he did design, and paint, the Chigi Chapel for the same patron, Agostino Chigi, the Papal Treasurer.
It has been claimed the Flemish Bernard van Orley worked for Raphael for a time, and Luca Penni, brother of Gianfrancesco, may have been a member of the team.
In contrast in England the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood explicitly reacted against his influence (and that of his admirers such as "Sir Sploshua"), seeking to return to styles before what they saw as his baneful influence.
He also painted many small and exquisite cabinet paintings in these years, probably mostly for the connoisseurs in the Urbino court, like the ''Three Graces'' and ''St.
The Pope's concerns were not exactly the same; he intended to continue to re-use ancient masonry in the building of St Peter's, but wanted to ensure that all ancient inscriptions were recorded, and sculpture preserved, before allowing the stones to be reused.
For Agostino Chigi, the hugely rich banker and Papal Treasurer, he painted the ''Triumph of Galatea'' and designed further decorative frescoes for his Villa Farnesina, and painted two chapels in the churches of Santa Maria della Pace and Santa Maria del Popolo.
Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed ''Mona Lisa'', but still looks completely Raphaelesque.
In the very small court of Urbino he was probably more integrated into the central circle of the ruling family than most court painters.
File:Portrait de l'artiste avec un ami, by Raffaello Sanzio, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|Possible ''Self-portrait with a friend'', c. 1518
This did however contribute to the diffusion of versions of Raphael's style around Italy and beyond.
There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost ''Leda and the Swan'', from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own ''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''.
Vasari also says that Raphael had also been born on a Good Friday, which in 1483 fell on March 28.
Wöllflin detects the influence of the Madonna in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo'' in the kneeling figure on the right, but the rest of the composition is far removed from his style, or that of Leonardo.
Most of the artists were later scattered, and some killed, by the violent Sack of Rome in 1527.
Raphael made preparatory drawings, many of which survive, for Raimondi to translate into engraving.
And as I told you, these are the two secondary causes of the decline of art; the first being the loss of moral purpose.
According to Vasari, Raphael's premature death on Good Friday (April 6, 1520), which was possibly his 37th birthday, was caused by a night of excessive sex with Luti, after which he fell into a fever and, not telling his doctors that this was its cause, was given the wrong cure, which killed him.
File:Raffael stcatherina.jpg|''Saint Catherine of Alexandria'', 1507, borrows from the pose of Leonardo's ''Leda''
These can be seen on the wall in ''The School of Athens'', and in the originals of many drawings.
And because his father was most worthy and I was very attached to him, and the son is a sensible and well-mannered young man, on both accounts, I bear him great love..."
He used different drawings to refine his poses and compositions, apparently to a greater extent than most other painters, to judge by the number of variants that survive: "...
Raphael painted several of his works on wood support (Madonna of the Pinks) but he also used canvas (Sistine Madonna) and he was known to employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils.
'''Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino''' (; April 6 or March 28, 1483April 6, 1520), known as '''Raphael''' (, ), was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.
The most famous original prints to result from the collaboration were ''Lucretia'', the ''Judgement of Paris'' and ''The Massacre of the Innocents'' (of which two virtually identical versions were engraved).
File:Massatbolsena.jpg|''The Mass at Bolsena'', 1514, Stanza di Eliodoro
Most Raphael drawings are rather precise—even initial sketches with naked outline figures are carefully drawn, and later working drawings often have a high degree of finish, with shading and sometimes highlights in white.
Raphael is described as a "master", that is to say fully trained, in December 1500.
Vasari claims he had toyed with the ambition of becoming a Cardinal, perhaps after some encouragement from Leo, which also may account for his delaying his marriage.
Vasari himself, despite his hero remaining Michelangelo, came to see his influence as harmful in some ways, and added passages to the second edition of the ''Lives'' expressing similar views.
Raimondi from a design by Raphael.
In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of Paolo Uccello, previously the court painter (d. 1475), and Luca Signorelli, who until 1498 was based in nearby Città di Castello.
This was a much larger and more important commission than any he had received before; he had only painted one altarpiece in Florence itself.
Raphael was one of the finest draftsmen in the history of Western art, and used drawings extensively to plan his compositions.
A total of about fifty prints were made; some were copies of Raphael's paintings, but other designs were apparently created by Raphael purely to be turned into prints.
After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models.
His first documented work was the ''Baronci altarpiece'' for the church of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino in Città di Castello, a town halfway between Perugia and Urbino.
But if, according to Longinus, the sublime, being the highest excellence that human composition can attain to, abundantly compensates the absence of every other beauty, and atones for all other deficiencies, then Michael Angelo demands the preference.
File:Urteil des Paris.jpg|''Judgement of Paris'', still influencing Manet, who used the seated group in his most famous work.
His poem to Federico shows him as keen to show awareness of the most advanced North Italian painters, and Early Netherlandish artists as well.
In 1515 he was given powers as "Prefect" over all antiquities unearthed entrusted within the city, or a mile outside.
Most of his work there was altered or demolished after his death and the acceptance of Michelangelo's design, but a few drawings have survived.
They were left many of Raphael's drawings and other possessions, and to some extent continued the workshop after Raphael's death.
Raphael led a "nomadic" life, working in various centres in Northern Italy, but spent a good deal of time in Florence, perhaps from about 1504.
File:PhrygianSibylRaphael.jpg|Drawing for a Sibyl in the Chigi Chapel.
According to Michael Levey, "Raphael gives his figures a superhuman clarity and grace in a universe of Euclidian certainties".
Raphael was highly admired by his contemporaries, although his influence on artistic style in his own century was less than that of Michelangelo.
File:Estudosguardasressurreicao-rafael-ashmuseum1.jpg|Study for soldiers in this ''Resurrection of Christ'', ca 1500.
As earlier with Perugino and others, Raphael was able to assimilate the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style.
Though highly regarded at the time, and much later forcibly removed from Perugia by the Borghese, it stands rather alone in Raphael's work.
Possible self-portrait by Raphael
Even incomplete, it was the most sophisticated villa design yet seen in Italy, and greatly influenced the later development of the genre; it appears to be the only modern building in Rome of which Palladio made a measured drawing.
After Bramante's death in 1514, Raphael was named architect of the new St Peter's.
After his early years in Rome much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality.
File:Deliveranceofstpeter.jpg|''Deliverance of Saint Peter'', 1514, Stanza di Eliodoro
Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model of the virtues of the Italian humanist court through Baldassare Castiglione's depiction of it in his classic work ''The Book of the Courtier'', published in 1528.
It was on an irregular island block near the river Tiber.
By the end of 1508, he had moved to Rome, where he lived for the rest of his life.
They give a highly idealised depiction of the forms represented, and the compositions, though very carefully conceived in drawings, achieve "sprezzatura", a term invented by his friend Castiglione, who defined it as "a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless ...".
File:PalaOddiRaffaello.jpg|The ''Coronation of the Virgin'' 1502–3
The painting is nearly all of the highest quality in the first two rooms, but the later compositions in the Stanze, especially those involving dramatic action, are not entirely as successful either in conception or their execution by the workshop.
File:Raphael's Triumph of Galatea 01.jpg|''Triumph of Galatea'', 1512, his only major mythology, for Chigi's villa.
Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother.
The version "without fir tree".
When a final composition was achieved, scaled-up full-size cartoons were often made, which were then pricked with a pin and "pounced" with a bag of soot to leave dotted lines on the surface as a guide.
Although there is traditional reference to a "Florentine period" of about 1504–8, he was possibly never a continuous resident there.
Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends.
There is a letter of recommendation of Raphael, dated October 1504, from the mother of the next Duke of Urbino to the Gonfaloniere of Florence: "The bearer of this will be found to be Raphael, painter of Urbino, who, being greatly gifted in his profession has determined to spend some time in Florence to study.
Other pupils or assistants include Raffaellino del Colle, Andrea Sabbatini, Bartolommeo Ramenghi, Pellegrino Aretusi, Vincenzo Tamagni, Battista Dossi, Tommaso Vincidor, Timoteo Viti (the Urbino painter), and the sculptor and architect Lorenzetto (Giulio's brother-in-law).
Growing up in the circle of this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by Vasari.
File:Transfiguration Raphael.jpg|''Transfiguration'', 1520, unfinished at his death.
Raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central Italian city of Urbino in the Marche region, where his father Giovanni Santi was court painter to the Duke.
