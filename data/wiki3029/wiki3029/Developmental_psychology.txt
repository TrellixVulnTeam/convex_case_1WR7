Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like dementia or traumatic lesions.
For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs. Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.
All parents have their own parenting styles.
With the advent of cognitive neuroscience, embryology and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.
Preschoolers explore and question their world.
Many researchers are interested in the interaction between personal characteristics, the individual's behavior and environmental factors, including social context and the built environment.
Children who develop “guilt” rather than “initiative” have failed Erikson’s psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.
Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time.
Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive of their children's behavior."
The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence.
The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves.
Children who are “encouraged and praised” develop belief in their competence.
* Hearing is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision.
Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.
During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus.
Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills.
Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem.
From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as perceptual learning.
The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem.
This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care.
Parenting styles, according to Kimberly Kopoko, are "based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth.
Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.
Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver.
''Middle Childhood (9-11).''
According to Fuzzy-trace theory, we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist.
Ultrasound has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.
If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other.
An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs.
Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver, or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect.
Discovery of new behaviors results from classical and operant conditioning, and the formation of habits.
Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").
One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life.
A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label.
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time, but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes.
Some primitive reflexes too arise before birth and are still present in newborns.
An early theory of infant development was the sensorimotor stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development.
Linguist Noam Chomsky asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a universal grammar that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified.
Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social.
According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives.
The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development.
Sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).
The sixth stage is "Intimacy vs.
If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops initiative.
They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows.
Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.
Epidemiological studies indicate that 30–50% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder.
Common research methods include systematic observation, including naturalistic observation or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or structured interviews; clinical or case study method; and ethnography or participant observation.These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study.
This adult role is often referred to as the skilled "master," whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed "cognitive apprenticeship."
The “peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.
Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge.
A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.
Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in gender roles, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.
Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.
Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes.
The third is the ''phallic stage'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age).
Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages.
Socially, the period of toddlerhood is commonly called the "terrible twos".
As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.
Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.
Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.
Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.
If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence.
The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language.
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen.
A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children.
Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.
James Mark Baldwin who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''.
Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward.
As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state.
Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.
The seventh stage is "Generativity vs. Stagnation".
Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development.
Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.
It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the moro and walking reflexes) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.
What sex role he/she picks.
By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.
An important characteristic of this age period is the development of language, where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.
Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver.
Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature.
Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen.
This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more independent variables and subsequent behavior, as measured by the dependent variable.
Children who achieve “success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence.”
Instead infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "A-not-B error."
He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''.
Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.
An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment.
Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.
Also, women experience menopause and a sharp drop in the hormone estrogen.
He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.
Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.
The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention.
This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.
The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future.
A related framework for studying this part of the life span is that of emerging adulthood.
* Touch and feel is one of the better-developed senses at birth considering it's one of the first senses to develop inside the womb.
No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands.
They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation or their immediate community or a sense of purposelessness.
Mental disintegration may also occur, leading to dementia or ailments such as Alzheimer's disease.
Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in erection and longer periods of penile stimulation required to achieve ejaculation.
One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on language acquisition.
This technique is called "scaffolding," because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.
Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.
Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.
He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct.
However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of domain-specific information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.
Emotional regulation or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts.
These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace.
At this stage infants also start to babble, producing phonemes.
Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences.
The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.
A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through learning.
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.
Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning.
John B. Watson and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.
Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development.
(Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)
The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother.
Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior.
This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver.
Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the ''experimental'', ''correlational'', or ''case study'' approach.
Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities.
If not, the child develops guilt.
Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant.
For example, the tonic neck reflex may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.
Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as, educational psychology, child psychopathology, forensic developmental psychology, child development, cognitive psychology, ecological psychology, and cultural psychology.
Early adulthood, according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on maintaining relationships.
The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age.
The World Health Organization finds “no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old.” Most “developed countries” set the age as 60 or 65.
The Centers for Disease Control (the CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives “developmental milestones for each stage.”
This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt.
If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.
# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years (preteen),
The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug.
Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.
The concept of critical periods is also well-established in neurophysiology, from the work of Hubel and Wiesel among others.
Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69.
However, in developing countries inability to make “active contribution” to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.
Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.
# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and
The eighth stage is "Ego Integrity vs.
This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society.
Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD).
Infants of around six months can differentiate between phonemes in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language.
He believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious, because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express.
In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way.
The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as "Who am I?
For children ages 9–11 “friendships and peer relationships” increase in strength, complexity, and importance.
To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego.
Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time.
Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan.
Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development'' has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments.
However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis.
Feral children such as Genie, deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood.
The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and developmental coordination disorder are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety.
Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously.
In not doing so, it could lead to isolation.
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.
Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies.
They become less self-centered and show “more concern for others”.
The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age).
In particular, a study in the U.S. and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls.
An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.
Sigmund Freud, whose concepts were developmental, had a significant impact on public perceptions.
Based on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each are characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy.
Lev Vygotsky was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.
Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in schizophrenia.
In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.
By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.
A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's genes.
Self-control also begins to develop.
Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood.
Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.
These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level.
Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of cognitive psychology and the psychology of individual differences into the interpretation and modeling of development.
While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.
During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed.
A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual.
During the genital stage, puberty starts happening.
Glucose is known to relieve pain in newborns.
This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the brain that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development.
Whether or not normal intelligence increases or decreases with age depends on the measure and study.
Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.
Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.
The experimental method involves "actual manipulation of various treatments, circumstances, or events to which the participant or subject is exposed; the ''experimental design'' points to cause-and-effect relationships.
Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause-and-effect relationships.
Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.
This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or normative) and occur in most members of a cohort.
He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; preconventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and postconventional moral reasoning.
This results in greater “peer pressure.” They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically.
or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g.
Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role.
Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the "zone of proximal development") could help children learn new tasks.
Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats.
Andropause in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females.

During their preschool years (3-5), they “enlarge their social horizons” to include people outside the family.
Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.
“to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings”.
The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her.
