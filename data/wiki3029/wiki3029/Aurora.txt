Aurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins approximately 70 meters (230 feet) above the Earth’s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night.
The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion.
The brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259 was discovered to have auroras in July 2015, the first extra-solar auroras discovered.
After the Battle of Fredericksburg, the lights could be seen from the battlefield that night.
However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them.
Different aspects of an aurora are elaborated in various sections below.
Some have speculated that material maybe being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf via stellar winds to produce its own electrons.
The name Aurora, however, simply comes from the Latin word for the dawn.
It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50&nbsp;mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.
The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history.
They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward.
In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator.
Venusian auroras are produced by the impact of electrons originating from the solar wind and precipitating in the night-side atmosphere.
A variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle.
Similar to the Earth's aurora, they are also visible close to the planets’  magnetic poles.
Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission.
Because Venus has no intrinsic (planetary) magnetic field, Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed across the full planetary disc.
The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.
An '''aurora''', sometimes referred to as a '''polar light''', is a natural light display in the sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions.
A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes.
For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultra-violet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans.
These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood.
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red.
In another example, there is little justification given for saying ’FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials  and the '''ion beam''' energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of '''auroral particle''' acceleration’.
Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere.
The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.
Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites.
Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora.
The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity.
The first Old Norse account of ''norðrljós'' is found in the Norwegian chronicle ''Konungs Skuggsjá'' from AD 1230, (long after the Viking age).
The total size of the emission region was about 30&nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&nbsp;km high.
Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.
The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.
Image:Aurora Australis From ISS.JPG|Aurora during a geomagnetic storm that was most likely caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun on 24 May 2010.
The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT).
Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space.
No mention is provided of either  the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible.
Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("magnetic reconnection"); some blobs ("plasmoids") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process").
Auroras seen within the auroral oval  may be directly overhead, but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction.
These ‘substorms’ tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component.
An animation created using the same satellite data is also available
Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth’s axis to the ecliptic plane.
Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia referred to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the ‘Land of the Dead’.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities.
There are other interesting effects such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and sub-visual red arcs.
That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the Parker spiral.
Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.
The Cree called the phenomenon the "'''Dance of the Spirits'''".
Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations.
Today, the Northern Lights are visible in Iceland from September to April.
In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.
Its southern counterpart, the '''''aurora australis''''' (or the '''southern lights'''), has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned.
(Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.)
Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east-west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also Birkeland currents).
An aurora may appear overhead as a "corona" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which  results from perspective.
Image:Aurora Borealis from Expedition 6.ogg|Aurora borealis from the International Space Station
Protons are also associated  with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.
Auroras also occur on other planets.
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind.
The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere.
Longer exposures superimpose  rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display.
The ‘diffuse’ aurora, on the other hand, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility.
* '''Green''': At lower altitudes the more frequent collisions suppress the 630.0&nbsp;nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates.
It is not known what the cause is.
Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.
The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere.
Most auroras occur in a band known as the ''auroral zone'', which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky.
The persona of Aurora the goddess has been incorporated in the writings of Shakespeare, Lord Tennyson, and Thoreau.
Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field.
The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun.
Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere.
The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the ''Boston Traveler'':
These are called "active aurora".
In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth.
This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field.
The electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere.
The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere.
Inexplicably though, some authors  still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.
On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.
* '''Red''': At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630.0&nbsp;nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity.
Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted.
The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply.
The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity.
Due to the different color spectrum  present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable.
The details of these phenomena are not fully understood.
Often there black aurora i.e.
As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons.
Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval.
While a striking notion, there is not a vast body of evidence in the Old Norse literature giving this interpretation, or even much reference to auroras.
Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora.
Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes.
It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked.
In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.
Fundamentally, Poisson’s equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.
Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.
Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.
The Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona.
In ancient Roman mythology, Aurora is the goddess of the dawn, renewing herself every morning to fly across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun.
These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.
Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955.
Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved.
The aurora is a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, mainly red in colour, because the charged particles are interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere.
The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.
The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires, that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side, or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.
Auroras also have been observed on the surfaces of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, using the Hubble Space Telescope.
These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines.
This  leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail ("magnetic substorms").
The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector).
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B.
In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter.
In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&nbsp;km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma.
The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth.
On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.
It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000&nbsp;km away from the magnetic pole.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.
It can also cause  particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere.
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space.
Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.
Thus it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90 degrees before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there.
By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet.
Green is the most common color.
The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius.
The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.
Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important.
However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.
This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000&nbsp;km (11 Earth radii or Re), producing a bow shock 12,000&nbsp;km to 15,000&nbsp;km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream.
Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.
Auroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars.
Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.
The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.
They also believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when the lights shone the brightest it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.
The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
The painting ''Aurora Borealis'' (see  ''Aurora Borealis'') (1865) by American landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.
The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth’s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year.
Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.
As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, ‘locked’ together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side.
Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.

'' composite image.
For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras "Puae buae", meaning "ashes", while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world.
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.
X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.
It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons.
Such events led to the general conclusion that
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.
;oxygen emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees.
An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express.
Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties.
The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength.
During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger.
In Medieval Europe, the auroras were commonly believed to be a sign from God.
This process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.
Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.
A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.
There is the claim from 1855 that in Norse mythology:
When the Dieri people of South Australia said that an auroral display was "Kootchee", an evil spirit creating a large fire.
The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
The increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a ‘magnetic mirror’ that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons.
* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and  molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen takes over in producing visible light emission; radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant.
;nitrogen emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.
Arcs can fragment or ‘break-up’ into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky.
They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated  into the atmosphere.
Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.
As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.
Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.
The auroras that resulted from the "great geomagnetic storm" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859 are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history.
Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.
This correlation indicates that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.
The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious.
Both the 557.7 and 630.0&nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7&nbsp;s and 107&nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.
The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer creating the noise.
Other shades of red as well as orange may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common.
Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.
In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken ''in the act''."
The Confederate Army took it as a sign that God was on their side during the battle as it was very rare that one could see the lights in Virginia.
narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity.
Although auroral activity is common over Scandinavia and Iceland today, it is possible that the Magnetic North Pole was considerably farther away from this region during the relevant period of Norse mythology.
It was reported by the ''New York Times'' that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light".
In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the '''''aurora borealis''''' (or the '''northern lights'''), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Galileo in 1619.
This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the  of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm.
A region that currently displays an aurora is called the ''auroral oval'', a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth.
That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history.
Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red.
Dene experience was that stroking caribou fur created sparks much like the aurora.
The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains.
Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through auroras.
Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.
In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.
Another possible explanation is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf, which is throwing off material to light it up, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.
