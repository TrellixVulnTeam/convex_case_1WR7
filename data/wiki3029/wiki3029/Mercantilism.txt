The word "mercantilism" was introduced into English from German in the early 19th century.
Under Colbert, the French government became deeply involved in the economy in order to increase exports.
It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664.
Critics like Hume, Dudley North, and John Locke undermined much of mercantilism, and it steadily lost favor during the 18th century.
'''Mercantilism''' was an economic theory and practice, dominant in modernized parts of Europe during the 16th to the 18th century, that promoted governmental regulation of a nation's economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers.
Historically, such policies frequently led to war and also motivated colonial expansion.
In an essay appearing in the 14 May 2007 issue of ''Newsweek'', business columnist Robert J. Samuelson argued that China was pursuing an essentially neo-mercantilist trade policy that threatened to undermine the post–World War II international economic structure.
* forbidding colonies to trade with other nations
Their theories also had several important problems, and the replacement of mercantilism did not come until Adam Smith published ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776.
Other than Von Hornick, there were no mercantilist writers presenting an overarching scheme for the ideal economy, as Adam Smith would later do for classical economics.
Murray Rothbard, representing the Austrian School of economics, describes it this way:
The second school, supported by scholars such as Robert B. Ekelund, portrays mercantilism not as a mistake, but rather as the best possible system for those who developed it.
* banning the export of gold and silver, even for payments
While Adam Smith portrayed mercantilism as supportive of strict controls over the economy, many mercantilists disagreed.
A wide array of regulations were put in place to encourage exports and discourage imports.
Of course, the impact of the discovery of America cannot be ignored.
Adam Smith and David Hume were the founding fathers of anti-mercantilist thought.
This period saw the adoption of the very Machiavellian realpolitik and the primacy of the ''raison d'état'' in international relations.
The new mercantilism has different goals and focuses on more rapid economic growth based on advanced technology.
The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain.
The early modern era was one of letters patent and government-imposed monopolies; some mercantilists supported these, but others acknowledged the corruption and inefficiency of such systems.
High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods, are an almost universal feature of mercantilist policy.
Those who feel that mercantilism amounted to rent seeking hold that it ended only when major power shifts occurred.
Isolated feudal estates were being replaced by centralized nation-states as the focus of power.
Mercantilists failed to understand the notions of absolute advantage and comparative advantage (although this idea was only fully fleshed out in 1817 by David Ricardo) and the benefits of trade.
Themes also existed in writers from the German historical school from List, as well as followers of the American system and British free-trade imperialism, thus stretching the system into the 19th century.
* maximizing the use of domestic resources
The critique that mercantilism was a form of rent seeking has also seen criticism, as scholars such Jacob Viner in the 1930s pointed out that merchant mercantilists such as Mun understood that they would not gain by higher prices for English wares abroad.
Italy and France produced noted writers of mercantilist themes, including Italy's Giovanni Botero (1544–1617) and Antonio Serra (1580–?)
* That every little bit of a country's soil be utilized for agriculture, mining or manufacturing.
The other nations of Europe also embraced mercantilism to varying degrees.
In 1690, John Locke argued that prices vary in proportion to the quantity of money.
Keynes said mercantilist policies generally improved both domestic and foreign investment—domestic because the policies lowered the domestic rate of interest, and investment by foreigners by tending to create a favorable balance of trade.
Mercantilism includes a national economic policy aimed at accumulating monetary reserves through a positive balance of trade, especially of finished goods.
While the wealthy capitalists who controlled the House of Commons benefited from these monopolies, Parliament found it difficult to implement them because of the high cost of group decision making.
Mercantilism developed at a time of transition for the European economy.
Russia under Peter I (Peter the Great) attempted to pursue mercantilism, but had little success because of Russia's lack of a large merchant class or an industrial base.
Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a zero-sum game, in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.
Keynes and other economists of the 20th century also realized that the balance of payments is an important concern.
Over the rest of the 16th century, further protectionist measures were introduced.
Some economists thus feel that protecting infant industries, while causing short-term harm, can be beneficial in the long term.
For instance, imagine that Portugal was a more efficient producer of wine than England, yet in England cloth could be produced more efficiently than it could in Portugal.
Mercantilists fundamentally misunderstood this, long arguing that an increase in the money supply simply meant that everyone gets richer.
It promotes such policies as substitution state taxation, subsidies, expenditures, and general regulatory powers for tariffs and quotas, and protection through the formation of supranational trading blocs.
Some other systems that do copy several mercantilist policies, such as Japan's economic system, are also sometimes called neo-mercantilist.
Mercantilists believed that to maximize a nation's power, all land and resources had to be used to their utmost, and this era thus saw projects like the draining of The Fens.
British mercantilism thus mainly took the form of efforts to control trade.
The similarities between Keynesianism (and its successor ideas) and mercantilism have sometimes led critics to call them neo-mercantilism.
Merchants benefited greatly from the enforced monopolies, bans on foreign competition, and poverty of the workers.
Overall, however, mercantilist policies had a positive impact on Britain helping turn it into the world's dominant trader and the global hegemon.
Industries were organized into guilds and monopolies, and production was regulated by the state through a series of more than one thousand directives outlining how different products should be produced.
* That opportunities be constantly sought for selling a country's surplus manufactures to foreigners, so far as necessary, for gold and silver.
Numerous French authors helped cement French policy around mercantilism in the 17th century.
This school argues that rent-seeking merchants and governments developed and enforced mercantilist policies.
Tariffs were placed on imports and bounties given for exports, and the export of some raw materials was banned completely.
To encourage industry, foreign artisans and craftsmen were imported.
One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of "waste lands" to agricultural use.
Keynes also supported government intervention in the economy as necessity, as did mercantilism.
A systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through Thomas Mun's argument ''England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure.''
The goal of mercantilist economic policies was to build up the state, especially in an age of incessant warfare, and the state should look for ways to strengthen the economy and weaken foreign adversaries.
Prior to mercantilism, the most important economic work done in Europe was by the medieval scholastic theorists.
In Britain, mercantilism faded as the Parliament gained the monarch's power to grant monopolies.
In England, mercantilism reached its peak during the Long Parliament government (1640–60).
Most wars had other causes but they reinforced mercantilism by clearly defining the enemy, and justified damage to the enemy's economy.
Neomercantilism is a 20th-century economic policy that uses the ideas and methods of neoclassical economics.
The ideology was embodied in New France through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627.
An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: "We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them."
* forbidding trade to be carried in foreign ships
In Europe, academic belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, especially in Britain, in light of the arguments of Adam Smith and the classical economists.
Thus if Portugal specialized in wine and England in cloth, ''both'' states would end up ''better off'' if they traded.
The next year, a number of restrictions were imposed on the export of bullion.
Protectionist policies were enacted that limited imports and favored exports.
Mercantilism in its simplest form is bullionism, yet mercantilist writers have emphasized the circulation of money and reject hoarding.
Mercantilism became prominent in Central Europe and Scandinavia after the Thirty Years' War (1618–48), with Christina of Sweden, Jacob Kettler of Courland, and Christian IV of Denmark being notable proponents.
Hume famously noted the impossibility of the mercantilists' goal of a constant positive balance of trade.
Some constituent states of the empire did embrace Mercantilism, most notably Prussia, which under Frederick the Great had perhaps the most rigidly controlled economy in Europe.
The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of Queen Elizabeth to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home.
Mercantilism focused on how this trade could best aid the states.
Monetarism offers a third explanation for mercantilism.
* That all raw materials found in a country be used in domestic manufacture, since finished goods have a higher value than raw materials.
Most of the European economists who wrote between 1500 and 1750 are today generally considered mercantilists; this term was initially used solely by critics, such as Mirabeau and Smith, but was quickly adopted by historians.
Mercantilist literature also extended beyond England.
While many nations applied the theory, one example was France, economically the most important state in Europe at the time.
It was determined that the state should rule in the economic realm as it did in the diplomatic, and that the interests of the state as identified by the king were superior to those of merchants and everyone else.
The Navigation Acts expelled foreign merchants from England's domestic trade.
* monopolizing markets with staple ports
Smith saw the English merchant Thomas Mun (1571–1641) as a major creator of the mercantile system, especially in his posthumously published ''Treasure by Foreign Trade'' (1664), which Smith considered the archetype or manifesto of the movement.
King Louis XIV followed the guidance of Jean Baptiste Colbert, his controller general of finances (1665–83).
In the English-speaking world its ideas were criticized by Adam Smith with the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776 and later by David Ricardo with his explanation of comparative advantage.
New markets and new mines propelled foreign trade to previously inconceivable volumes, resulting in "the great upward movement in prices" and an increase in "the volume of merchant activity itself".
Extra money, free time, and education for the lower classes were seen to inevitably lead to vice and laziness, and would result in harm to the economy.
* promoting manufacturing through research or direct subsidies
The idea of mercantilism was to protect the markets, but it also helped to maintain the agriculture and those who were dependent upon it.
Colbert's policies were quite successful, and France's industrial output and economy grew considerably during this period, as France became the dominant European power.
The mercantilist idea of all trade as a zero-sum game, in which each side was trying to best the other in a ruthless competition, was integrated into the works of Thomas Hobbes.
Smith spent a considerable portion of the book rebutting the arguments of the mercantilists, though often these are simplified or exaggerated versions of mercantilist thought.
* That all imports of foreign goods be discouraged as much as possible.
Keynes also noted that in the early modern period the focus on the bullion supplies was reasonable.
This accounting made extremely clear the inflow and outflow of trade, contributing to the close scrutiny given to the balance of trade.
Eventually it would no longer be cost-effective to export goods from the high-price country to the low-price country, and the balance of trade would reverse.
Mercantilism was centred on England and France, and it was in these states that mercantilist polices were most often enacted.
Rather, each mercantilist writer tended to focus on a single area of the economy.
Mercantilism was the economic version of warfare using economics as a tool for warfare by other means backed up by the state apparatus, and was well suited to an era of military warfare.
They believe Mun and Misselden were not making this mistake in the 1620s, and point to their followers Josiah Child and Charles Davenant, who in 1699 wrote, "Gold and Silver are indeed the Measure of Trade, but that the Spring and Original of it, in all nations is the Natural or Artificial Product of the Country; that is to say, what this Land or what this Labour and Industry Produces."
The opposing doctrine of physiocracy predicted that mankind would outgrow its resources.
The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them.
Adam Smith noted that at the core of the mercantile system was the "popular folly of confusing wealth with money", that bullion was just the same as any other commodity, and that there was no reason to give it special treatment.
Conversely, in the state exporting bullion, its value would slowly rise.
Mature neomercantilist theory recommends selective high tariffs for "infant" industries or to promote the mutual growth of countries through national industrial specialization.
A fourth explanation lies in the increasing professionalisation and technification of the wars of the era, which turned the maintenance of adequate reserve funds (in the prospect of war) into a more and more expensive and eventually competitive business.
In Britain, government control over the domestic economy was far less extensive than on the Continent, limited by common law and the steadily increasing power of Parliament.
The evidence for this hypothesis is the lack of inflation in the British economy until the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when paper money came into vogue.
In time, the heavy emphasis on money was supplanted by industrial policy, accompanied by a shift in focus from the capacity to carry on wars to promoting general prosperity.
The British Empire embraced free trade and used its power as the financial centre of the world to promote the same.
It was in turn replaced by La Compagnie des Cent-Associés created in 1627, by King Louis XIII and the Communauté des habitants in 1643.
He was less successful in turning France into a major trading power, and Britain and the Netherlands remained supreme in this field.
Government-controlled monopolies were common, especially before the English Civil War, but were often controversial.
, the word "mercantilism" remains a pejorative term, often used to attack various forms of protectionism.
* That no importation be allowed if such goods are sufficiently and suitably supplied at home.
They focused mainly on microeconomics and on local exchanges between individuals.
Mercantilist ideas were the dominant economic ideology of all of Europe in the early modern period, and most states embraced it to a certain degree.
Mercantilism arose in France in the early 16th century soon after the monarchy had become the dominant force in French politics.
The Austrian lawyer one of the pioneers of Cameralism and scholar Philipp Wilhelm von Hornick, in his ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'' of 1684, detailed a nine-point program of what he deemed effective national economy, which sums up the tenets of mercantilism comprehensively:
Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time.
This French mercantilism was best articulated by Jean-Baptiste Colbert (in office, 1665–1683), though policy liberalised greatly under Napoleon.
* That where certain imports are indispensable they be obtained at first hand, in exchange for other domestic goods instead of gold and silver.
In France, economic control remained in the hands of the royal family, and mercantilism continued until the French Revolution.
In an era before paper money, an increase in bullion was one of the few ways to increase the money supply.
* That as much as possible, imports be confined to raw materials that can be finished in the home country.
The Netherlands, which had become the financial centre of Europe by being its most efficient trader, had little interest in seeing trade restricted and adopted few mercantilist policies.
* That all export of gold and silver be prohibited and all domestic money be kept in circulation.
Adam Smith rejected the mercantilist focus on production, arguing that consumption was paramount to production.
and, in France, Jean Bodin, Colbert.
Technological changes in shipping and the growth of urban centres led to a rapid increase in international trade.
Whereas later economic ideas were often developed by academics and philosophers, almost all mercantilist writers were merchants or government officials.
Mercantilism fueled the imperialism of this era, as many nations expended significant effort to conquer new colonies that would be sources of gold (as in Mexico) or sugar (as in the West Indies), as well as becoming exclusive markets.
Those who believe the theory was simply an error hold that its replacement was inevitable as soon as Smith's more accurate ideas were unveiled.
The Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors had long been interested in mercantilist policies, but the vast and decentralized nature of their empire made implementing such notions difficult.
The mercantilists saw a large population as a form of wealth which made possible the development of bigger markets and armies.
Thus, any system of policies that benefited one group would by definition harm the other, and there was no possibility of economics being used to maximize the commonwealth, or common good.
Mercantilism was rejected by Britain and France by the mid-19th century.
In 1539, an important decree banned the import of woolen goods from Spain and some parts of Flanders.
However, many British writers, including Mun and Misselden, were merchants, while many of the writers from other countries were public officials.
* subsidies on exports
This is an example of the reciprocal benefits of trade (whether due to comparative or absolute advantage).
England began the first large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the Elizabethan Era (1558–1603).
The authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include Gerard de Malynes and Thomas Mun, who first articulated the Elizabethan system, which in turn was then developed further by Josiah Child.
The height of French mercantilism is closely associated with Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister for 22 years in the 17th century, to the extent that French mercantilism is sometimes called '''Colbertism'''.
European trade exported bullion to pay for goods from Asia, thus reducing the money supply and putting downward pressure on prices and economic activity.
* restricting domestic consumption through non-tariff barriers to trade.
The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish, or Dutch.
Queen Elizabeth promoted the Trade and Navigation Acts in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping.
* That a large, working population be encouraged.
With respect to its colonies,  British mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires.
Smith saw the mercantile system as an enormous conspiracy by manufacturers and merchants against consumers, a view that has led some authors, especially Robert E. Ekelund and Robert D. Tollison, to call mercantilism "a rent-seeking society".
The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London.
However, John Maynard Keynes argued that encouraging production was just as important as encouraging consumption, and he favoured the "new mercantilism".
Originally the standard English term was "mercantile system".
Other policies have included
The term "mercantile system" was used by its foremost critic, Adam Smith, but "mercantilism" had been used earlier by Mirabeau.
It sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself.
Some scholars thus reject the idea of mercantilism completely, arguing that it gives "a false unity to disparate events".
Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664.
The goal of these thinkers was to find an economic system compatible with Christian doctrines of piety and justice.
The importance placed on bullion was also a central target, even if many mercantilists had themselves begun to de-emphasize the importance of gold and silver.
Only later did non-mercantilist scholars integrate these "diverse" ideas into what they called mercantilism.
The goal was to maximize production, with no concern for consumption.
This dark view of human nature also fit well with the Puritan view of the world, and some of the most stridently mercantilist legislation, such as the Navigation Ordinance of 1651, was enacted by the government of Oliver Cromwell.
The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—through trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm.
To a certain extent, mercantilist doctrine itself made a general theory of economics impossible.
Another important change was the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping and modern accounting.
Locke's ''Second Treatise'' also points towards the heart of the anti-mercantilist critique: that the wealth of the world is not fixed, but is created by human labor (represented embryonically by Locke's labor theory of value).
The bulk of what is commonly called "mercantilist literature" appeared in the 1620s in Great Britain.
Mercantilist domestic policy was more fragmented than its trade policy.
These efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of England against the far larger and more powerful Spanish Empire, and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the 19th century.
Mercantilist policies were also embraced throughout much of the Tudor and Stuart periods, with Robert Walpole being another major proponent.
Their emphasis on monetary metals accords with current ideas regarding the money supply, such as the stimulative effect of a growing money supply.
European power spread around the globe, often under the aegis of companies with government-guaranteed monopolies in certain defined geographical regions, such as the Dutch East India Company or the British Hudson's Bay Company (operating in present-day Canada).
Perhaps the last major mercantilist work was James Steuart's ''Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767.
Jean-Baptiste Colbert's work in 17th-century France came to exemplify classical mercantilism.
This led to friction with the inhabitants of these colonies, and mercantilist policies (such as forbidding trade with other empires and controls over smuggling) were a major irritant leading to the American Revolution.
One notion that mercantilists widely agreed upon was the need for economic oppression of the working population; laborers and farmers were to live at the "margins of subsistence".
Mercantilist regulations were steadily removed over the course of the 18th century in Britain, and during the 19th century the British government fully embraced free trade and Smith's laissez-faire economics.
A number of wars, most notably the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the Franco-Dutch Wars, can be linked directly to mercantilist theories.
Indeed, Paul Samuelson, writing within a Keynesian framework, defended mercantilism, writing, "With employment less than full and Net National Product suboptimal, all the debunked mercantilist arguments turn out to be valid."
Scholars are also divided over the cause of mercantilism's end.
The first school to completely reject mercantilism was the physiocrats, who developed their theories in France.
In Germany mercantilism remained an important ideology in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the historical school of economics was paramount.
Adam Smith himself, for instance, praised the Navigation Acts, as they greatly expanded the British merchant fleet and played a central role in turning Britain into the world's naval and economic superpower from the 18th century onward.
This book outlines the basics of what is today known as classical economics.
British mercantilist writers were themselves divided on whether domestic controls were necessary.
Specie concerns have since been rendered irrelevant by fiat money and floating exchange rates.
These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.
More recently, scholars have discounted the accuracy of this critique.
Beyond mercantilism as a way of understanding the wealth and power of nations, Mun and Misselden are noted for their viewpoints on a wide range of economic matters.
As bullion flowed into one country, the supply would increase, and the value of bullion in that state would steadily decline relative to other goods.
He added that mercantilism was popular among merchants because it was what is now called rent seeking.
On the continent, the process was somewhat different.
France imposed its mercantilist philosophy on its colonies in North America, especially New France.
The repeal of the Corn Laws by Robert Peel symbolised the emergence of free trade as an alternative system.
