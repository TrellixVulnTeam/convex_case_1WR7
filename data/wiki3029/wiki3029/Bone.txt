Bones serve a variety of mechanical functions.
After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as "bony substitution."
They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions.
These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins.
Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells.
Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals and also enable mobility as well as support for the body.
Osteoblasts line up along the walls of these channels and begin depositing concentric lamellae of matrix, while osteoclasts dissolve the temporarily calcified cartilage.
Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-ligand and interleukin 6, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts.
* Osteoclasts are the cells responsible for bone resorption, thus they break down bone.
Bone char, a porous, black, granular material primarily used for filtration and also as a black pigment, is produced by charring mammal bones.
Palliative care, which focuses on maximising a person's quality of life, may play a role in management, particularly if the likelihood of survival within five years is poor.
Osteoblasts are involved in the creation and mineralisation of bone; osteocytes and osteoclasts are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue.
Around the strands calcium and phosphate precipitate on the surface of these strands, within a days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.
Preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve the process of maceration.
This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.
This means that bone resists pushing(compressional) stress well, resist pulling(tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads).
Osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells.
# Zone of calcification.
Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, depending on the location of the fracture.
* Osteocytes are mostly inactive osteoblasts.
Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or when there is a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget's disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer.
This may lead to compression of the spinal cord, destruction of the marrow resulting in bruising, bleeding and immunosuppression, and is one cause of bone pain.
Cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface.
Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue.
A bird's beak is primarily made of bone as projections of the mandibles which are covered in keratin.
Fractures and their underlying causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs.
However, that proportion may be much lower, especially in marine mammals and marine turtles, or in various Mesozoic marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, among others.
Calcium supplements may also be advised, as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing Hormone replacement therapy.
The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors.
Bones can serve a number of uses such as projectile points or artistic pigments, and can also be made from external bones such as antlers.
Bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix around entrapped cells.
They robustly produce alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that has a role in the mineralisation of bone, as well as many matrix proteins.
In order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete vesicles containing alkaline phosphatase.
When a doctor sees a patient, a history and exam will be taken.
New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts.
Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body.
Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including leukemia and multiple myeloma.
Essentially the same process, with further refinement, thickening and drying, is used to make gelatin.
Bone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as remodeling.
The extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by osteoblasts, which secrete both collagen and ground substance.
In prehistoric times, they have been used for making bone tools.
A little closer to the marrow cavity, chondrocytes multiply and arrange themselves into longitudinal columns of flattened lacunae.
Cancers that arise in bone are called "primary" cancers, although such cancers are rare.
These are not the permanent mineral deposits of bone, but only a temporary support for the cartilage that would otherwise soon be weakened by the breakdown of the enlarged lacunae.
In adults woven bone is created after fractures or in Paget's disease.
A common long bone fracture in children is a Salter–Harris fracture.
In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used.

Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes.
The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change.
Cancellous bones contain bone marrow.
The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and also to shape and sculpt the skeleton during growth..
This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition.
Bones from slaughtered animals have a number of uses.
This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow.

The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2&nbsp;µm per day.
This matrix consists of organic components, mainly collagen – "organic" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body – and inorganic components, primarily hydroxyapatite and other salts of calcium and phosphate.
Bone is an active tissue composed of different types of bone cells.
Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.
Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly.
Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed ''woven''.
It is frequently used in anthropology, archeology and forensic science for a variety of tasks.
It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.

Bone marrow, also known as myeloid tissue, can be found in almost any bone that holds cancellous tissue.
Bone is not a uniformly solid material, but is mostly a matrix.
* Woven bone, (also known as ''fibrous bone'') which is characterized by a haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak
These cells include osteoblasts, which are involved in the creation and mineralization of bone tissue, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue.
Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called "postmenopausal osteoporosis", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids.
In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.
For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.

These same compounds also increase secretion of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.
Minerals are deposited in the matrix between the columns of lacunae and calcify the cartilage.
Woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all fetal bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone.
Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary, thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens).
As well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.
This can include determining the nutritional, health, age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from.

Next, the chondrocytes cease to divide and begin to hypertrophy (enlarge), much like they do in the primary ossification center of the fetus.
Among mammals, bats come closest to birds in terms of bone density, suggesting that small dense bones are a flight adaptation.
Osteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue.

They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones.
They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).
The exact composition of the matrix may change over time and with nutrition, with the ratio of calcium to phosphate varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and carbonate also being found.
