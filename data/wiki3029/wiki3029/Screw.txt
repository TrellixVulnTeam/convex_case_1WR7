A bolt that is threaded all the way to the head.
es, square drivers, etc.
Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.
When the appropriate torque is reached the spline shears off.
An ASME B18.2.1 compliant set/tap bolt has the same tolerances as an ASME B18.2.1 compliant hex cap screw.
Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document ''Distinguishing Bolts from Screws'', the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance.
Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and "clinch bolts" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding.
Larger ones are sometimes called lag eye screws.
Carriage bolts are used to provide a smooth finish on automobile metal bumper exteriors, the square section aligning with a square hole in the bumper to provide anti-rotation.
Threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.
Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century.
The second type and more common connection is a bearing connection.
They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.
They are bolts because they have a shank (or shoulder), which is necessary for them to perform their function as a coach bolt, which is to pull one piece of material against another using only the thread.
The shank is usually threaded up to the head.
There are many variations.
Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.
These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).
They are sometimes notched at the tip to aid in chip removal during thread cutting.
By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking.
The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 &times; number.
A power tool that does the same job is a ''power screwdriver''; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments.
The advantage of this screw type over a self-drilling screw is that, if the screw is reinstalled, new threads are not cut as the screw is driven.
As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA.
Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a ''female thread'' (internal thread), often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it.
A machine screw is generally a smaller fastener (less than  in diameter) threaded the entire length of its shank that usually has a recessed drive type (slotted, Phillips, etc.).
Some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied.
The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a ''spanner'' (UK usage) or ''wrench'' (US usage), while a ''nut setter'' is used with a power screw driver.
Currently, it most narrowly refers to a style of head (see the gallery below).
Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.
High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called ''property class'') stamped on the head.
), so that it can be driven twice as fast as a normal (i.e.
Modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them.
The federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each.
Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener.
Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others.
This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly.
If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength.
The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized.
They are usually made of low grade steel, have a slot or Phillips drive, and are used to join sheet metal parts using a hex or square nut.
Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today.
Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.
The field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse.
These developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners.
Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System.
bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g.
A breakaway bolt is a bolt with a hollow threaded shank, which is designed to break away upon impact.
Meanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735–1800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe.
A socket cap screw, also known as a ''socket head capscrew'', ''socket screw'', or ''Allen bolt'', is a type of cap screw with a cylindrical head and hexagonal drive hole.
A screw, on the other hand, has a thread running its entire length, a set screw, for example.
Same with lag bolts.
Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together.
The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt.
A typical lag bolt can range in diameter from  to , and lengths from  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).
Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.
These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries.
If the screw is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn the screw in the direction of your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your thumb.
They have bugle heads that allows the screw to depress the wood surface without breaking it.
The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining.
Square head cap screws up to and including  have a head  larger than the shank; screws larger than  have a head  larger than the shank.
Socket head capscrews are commonly used in assemblies that do not provide sufficient clearance for a conventional wrench or socket.
Structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century.
The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.
A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw ''screws into something'', a bolt ''bolts several things together'').
It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with "thread adapters" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread.
The hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a ''screwdriver''.
Specialized screw with a bugle head that is designed to attach drywall to wood or metal studs, however it is a versatile construction fastener with many uses.
In the past, the term ''cap screw'', in general, referred to screws that were supposed to be used in applications where a nut was not used, however the characteristics that differentiated it from a bolt vary over time.
The nature of the tolerance difference allows an ASME B18.2.1 hex cap screw to always fit where a hex bolt is installed but a hex bolt could be slightly too large to be used where a hex cap screw is designed in.
Throughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons.
In the United States, cap screws are defined by ASME B18.6.2 and ASME B18.3.
self-tapping machine screw
The head is usually domed and is not designed to be driven.
Ultimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails.
Bearing type connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint.
There were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread.
The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry.
A hanger bolt is used when it is necessary to fasten a metal part to a wood surface.
While not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6&nbsp;mm diameter and 1&nbsp;mm pitch.
They are key components of micrometers and lathes.
, timber railway trestles and bridges) to one another, or to fasten wood to masonry or concrete.
The same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material.
The majority of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a ''right-hand thread''; a common mnemonic device for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey."
The adjective ''lag'' came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.
Similar to a wood screw but with two pointed ends and no head, used for making hidden joints between two pieces of wood.A hanger bolt has wood screw threads on one end and machine threads on the other.
If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations.
So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of "screws" you would not expect nuts to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts.
The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe.
The necessary dimensions for the head styles can be found in the standard.
The term fine adjustment screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40–100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra fine adjustment screw has been used to refer to 100–254 TPI (0.2mm to 0.1mm pitch).
In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension.
A tension control bolt (TC bolt) is a heavy duty bolt used in steel frame construction.
These were easy to machine and  served most applications adequately.
These terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the ''Machinery's Handbook'' distinction they would be screws.
Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases.
A metal screw with a sharp point designed to attach two pieces of wood together.
Common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers and wrenches.
Lag bolts are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.
On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt.
It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank.
Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured.
These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts.
However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection.
These have a lobed (usually triangular) cross-section.
However, in the minds of many tradesmen, they are "bolts", simply because they are large, with hex or square heads.
The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance).
There are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems.
Most deck screws have a type-17 (auger type) thread cutting tip for installation into decking materials.
In some cases the properly prepared hole in sheetmetal uses an extruded hole.
The set screw is driven through a threaded hole in the rotating part until it is tight against the shaft.
Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g.
Thread rolling screws are often used where loose chips formed by a thread cutting operation cannot be tolerated.
In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not.
Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut.
They may either have a Phillips flat head or a slotted hex washer head.
screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A.
Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around the screw with your thumb pointing is the direction you want the screw to go.
The American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections.
Shoulder screws can be manufactured in many materials such as alloy heat-treated steel for maximum strength and wear resistance and stainless steel for its corrosion-resistance and non-magnetic properties.
However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System.
Whitworth became ''British Standard Whitworth'', abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the ''British Standard Fine'' (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications.
The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9.
The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force.
ASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws that range in size from  in diameter.
In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.
Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2.
Mild steel bolts have property class 4.6, with is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength.
Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.
However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings.
What has occurred here is the loss of history, resulting in the need to rename some bolts as screws to meet the new definition.
The words ''bolt'' and ''screw'' have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change.
Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.
The square section grips into the part being fixed (typically wood), preventing the bolt from turning when the nut is tightened.
The most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding.
The coarse thread of a lag bolt and lag mesh and deform slightly making a secure near water tight anti-corroding mechanically strong fastening.
Some of these issues are discussed below:
Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.
On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.
to its beam, where a raised head would suffer from soil abrasion.
Therefore, "SS cap screw" means "stainless steel cap screw" but "SHSS" means "socket head set screw".
A hex cap screw is a cap screw with a hexagonal head, designed to be driven by a wrench (spanner).
Wood screws are commonly available with flat, pan or oval-heads.
shoulder boltshoulder screw
ASME B18.9 standard recommends a No.
Typically used to fasten fire hydrants, so they will ''break away'' when hit by a car.
double ended screwdowel screwhanger bolt
For sizes  inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16.
In 1913, Woolley and Meredith defined them like Anthony, but gave the following dimensions: hex head cap screws up to and including  have a head that is  larger than the shank diameter; screws greater than  in diameter have a head that is  larger than the shank.
Common applications for shoulder screws include rotating mechanism joints, linkage pivots, and guides for the stripper plate of a metal forming die set.
This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.
A fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-as'''SEM'''bled.
The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent.
The word ''bolt'' is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.).
It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later).
It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.
Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running.
An elevator bolt is a bolt similar to a carriage bolt, except the head is thin and flat.
BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 "Specification for British Association (B.A.)
A '''screw''' is a type of fastener, sometimes similar to a bolt (see ''Differentiation between bolt and screw'' below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a ''male thread'' (external thread) or just ''thread''.
Has sharp threads that cut into a material such as sheet metal, plastic or wood.
A carriage bolt, also known as a coach bolt, has a domed or countersunk head, and the shank is topped by a short square section under the head.
Smooth round or mushroom headed with a multi-start thread on the shank, beneath which is reduced diameter shank that acts as a pilot.
Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" Whitworth (16 tpi).
5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.
Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.
A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had ''invented'' the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.
As the term suggests vine eyes are often used for attaching wire lines across the surface of buildings so that climbing plants can attach themselves.
The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.
self-drilling screwTeks screw
It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.67
Designed to be used as attachment point, particularly for something that is hung from it.A vine eye (in the UK at least) is similar to a screw eye, except that it has a proportionally longer shank and smaller looped head.
'''Lag screws (US)''' or '''coach screws (UK / Australia / New Zealand)''' (also referred to as '''bolts''', although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws.
ASME standards specify a variety of "Machine Screws" in diameters ranging up to .
Similar to a sheet metal screw, but it has a drill-shaped point to cut through the substrate to eliminate the need for drilling a pilot hole.
The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries.
Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.
Old USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded.
Heads sizes range from  and lengths from .
The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the ''shank''; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded.
Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts.
They form threads in a pre-existing hole in the mating workpiece by pushing the material outward during installation.
Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank.
It is usually used to mount a mirror.
Chiefly used for attaching manufacturers data plates to equipment.
This distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for ''screw'' and ''bolt''.
If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.
eye screwscrew eyevine eye
An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.
Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain.
Shoulder screw specifications call out the shoulder diameter, shoulder length, and threaded diameter; the threaded length is fixed, based on the threaded diameter, and usually quite short.
Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required.
Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and ''torque-limiting screwdrivers'' are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw.
Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate.
''Machinery's Handbook'' refers parenthetically to these fasteners as "Finished Hex Bolts".
The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms "coarse" and "fine" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to "high-quality" or "low-quality", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).
The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a ''bearing surface''.
Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.
More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.
The abbreviation "SS" more often means stainless steel.
In the latter application, the term stripper bolt is often substituted.
