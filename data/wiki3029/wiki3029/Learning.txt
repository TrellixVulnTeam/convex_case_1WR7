# '''Testing:''' Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning.
Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not.
'''Habituation''' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the response is repeated.
Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners.
Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.
These five types of play are often intersecting.
'''Learning''' is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing existing, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information.
# '''Motivational behavior''': Motivation means to provide with a motive.
Small learners need more guidance.
In fact, a study of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.
An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change.
* learner-content (i.e.
Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
Self-education can be improved with systematization.
Studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.
So when teaching an individual a response, you need to find the most potent reinforcer for that person.
If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighes the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves.
It may be goal-oriented and may be aided by motivation.
The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
It encourages a student to move over tasks  further.
Conversely, passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or traditional education).
# '''Goals or purposes''': Each and everyone has a goal.
In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.
In operant conditioning, a certain behavior is either reinforced or punished, which alters the probability that the behavior will reoccur.
Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc.
Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus").
However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving physical fitness.
If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary.
'''Sensitization''' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus (Bell et al., 1995).
Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.
According to experts in natural learning,
Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection.
They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, teaching, etc.
Behaviorism is a psychological movement that seeks to alter behavior by arranging the environment to elicit successful changes and to arrange consequences to maintain or diminish a behavior.
'''Meaningful learning''' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge.
Students who answer a  question properly or give good results should be praised.
# '''Interest:''' This is a quality that arouses a feeling.
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993) contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).
The typical paradigm for '''classical conditioning''' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response).
Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# '''Aptitude:'''  Aptitude is natural ability.
This makes learning more effective.
# role play occurs from 3 to 15 years of age
A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve.
This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results.
Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism.
These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development.
By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment.
Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.
In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge.
Size, configuration, comfort - fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture – can all affect a students’ learning.
''Operant conditioning'' is distinguished from ''Pavlovian conditioning'' in that operant conditioning uses reinforcement/punishment to alter an action-outcome association.
This is determined by what we find are the most reinforcing stimuli.
Motivation  learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest.
After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful.
The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.
Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.
Progress over time tends to follow a learning curve.
Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning.
For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the proboscis extension reflex paradigm.
To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.
The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
# construction play involves experimentation and building
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.
Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder.
Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''Mimosa pudica''  and the large protozoan ''Stentor coeruleus''.
'''Nonformal learning''' is organized learning outside the formal learning system.
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive.
This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.
'''Informal learning''' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going).
The native intelligence is different in individuals.
How we make those decisions is based on what we perceive are the most valuable or worthwhile actions.
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.
To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.
However, in other scenarios the opposite is true - animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior.
# '''Attention''': Attention means consideration.
'''Episodic learning''' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.
When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called augmented learning.
Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time.
Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice).
Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning.
Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child’s learning and development.
For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again.
'''Dialogic learning''' is a type of learning based on dialogue.
This may be a larger reinforcer at a later time or a smaller immediate reinforcer.
It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by previous knowledge.
To learn a skill, such as solving a Rubik's Cube quickly, several factors come into play at once:
The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate.
In the former, a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly presented, together with a reflex eliciting stimuli, until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own.
Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.
There are five types of play:
Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information – non-learning evolves.
Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies.
Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR).
Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.
To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding.
Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".
An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk.
Impulsivity is a core process for many behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, problematic gambling, OCD).
Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.
Each student is unique and has different abilities.
Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR).
Non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization.
However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve.
Elemental theories of associative learning argue that concurrent stimuli tend to be perceived as separate units rather than 'holistically' (i.e.
For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.
However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.
A goal is an aim or desired result.
In these situations, learning evolves in the species.
The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies.
# '''Attitude:''' It is a way of thinking.
Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.
For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted.
Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey.
If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.
Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system.
Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.
It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, play, exploring, etc.
; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.
Active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning.
Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is John B. Watson.
However, they do not deny that there are thought processes that interact with those behaviors (see Relational Frame Theory for more information).
Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection.
Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced.
Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned.
Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.
Animals gain knowledge in two ways .
Soon the birds react less, showing habituation.
Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally.
This process is thought to be tied to impulsivity.
Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration.
Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods.
# '''Heredity''': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use it and develop it.
# '''Learning activities:''' Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized.
# '''Physical environment''':  The design, quality, and setting of a learning space, such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a learning environment.
By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects.
Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play.
Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its history (affective domain).
In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits.
'''Multimedia learning''' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information .
Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "Little Albert", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.
Delayed discounting is the process of devaluing rewards based on the delay of time they are presented.
Active learning occurs when a person takes control of their learning experience.
'''Associative learning''' is the process by which someone learns an association between two stimuli, or a behavior and a stimulus.
If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place).
If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously.
As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.
In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.
The study of how learning occurs is part of educational psychology, neuropsychology, learning theory, and pedagogy.
Home is a place where a family lives.
Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder.
It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
If effective learning should take place attention is essential.
Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment.
Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.
However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous.
These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected.
Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped is called learned helplessness.
Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as orcas playing with seals they have caught.
In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent.
The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed.
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "muscle memory" and speed.
This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information.
In contrast, Pavlovian conditioning involves strengthening of the stimulus-outcome association.
intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners’ understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.
Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings.
For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
'''Tangential learning''' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy.
A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur.
A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him.
Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness.
'''Imprinting''' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior.
This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to mammals and birds.
Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios.
During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning.
; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning.
'''Rote learning''' is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard.
Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data.
As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions.
Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.
Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.
# '''Fatigue:''' Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental.
In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science.
In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
Guidance is an advice to solve a problem.
# movement play aka physical play
The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''.
