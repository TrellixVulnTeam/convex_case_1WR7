William Shakespeare is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with ''Hamlet'' his most-quoted work.
Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles.
In 1919–1920, J. R. R. Tolkien was employed by the ''OED'', researching etymologies of the ''Waggle'' to ''Warlock'' range; later he parodied the principal editors as "The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford" in the story ''Farmer Giles of Ham''.
Revisions were started at the letter ''M'', with new material appearing every three months on the ''OED Online'' website.
Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.
The Dutch dictionary ''Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal'' has similar aims to the ''OED'', is the largest, and took twice as long to complete.
By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble.
For the first time, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size.
On 14 March 2000, the ''Oxford English Dictionary Online'' (''OED Online'') became available to subscribers.
He writes that the ''OED'''s "black-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage.
Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the American Civil War, and was confined to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after killing a man in London.
Despite its impressive size, the ''OED'' is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language.
In 1902, he declined to add the word "radium" to the dictionary.
The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989.
Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.
If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.
Yet many definitions contained outdated scientific theories, historical information, and moral values.
It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.
Furnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed.
*Inconsistent coverage of families of related words
Version 1 (1992) was identical in content to the printed second edition, and the CD itself was not copy-protected.
Version 3.1.1 (2007) added support for hard disk installation, so that the user does not have to insert the CD to use the dictionary.
As a historical dictionary, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages.
The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places.
As of 30 November 2005, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' contained approximately 301,100 main entries.
Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests.
However, in the end only three ''Additions'' volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997, each containing about 3,000 new definitions.
As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.
It has been reported that this version will work on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, using emulation programs.
Murray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet.
'', ''Cham'', ''Creel'', ''Dvandva'', ''Follow'', ''Hat'', ''Interval'', ''Look'', ''Moul'', ''Ow'', ''Poise'', ''Quemadero'', ''Rob'', ''Ser'', ''Soot'', ''Su'', ''Thru'', ''Unemancipated'', and ''Wave''.
He then approached James Murray, who accepted the post of editor.
In his review of the 1982 supplement, University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the ''OED'' is extremely difficult because "one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution", one that "has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle".
Furthermore, many of the slips had been misplaced.
The dictionary began as a Philological Society project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to Oxford University): Richard Chenevix Trench, Herbert Coleridge, and Frederick Furnivall, who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries.
Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the ''OED2'' adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet.
According to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to "key in" the 59 million words of the ''OED'' second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 megabytes to store them electronically.
It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and ''A User's Guide to the "Oxford English Dictionary"'', by Donna Lee Berg.
The total sales were a disappointing 4,000 copies.
It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement ''(OEDS)'' had grown to four volumes, starting with ''A'', ''H'', ''O'', and ''Sea''.
The possibilities of the World Wide Web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved.
The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived.
Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project,  LEXX, was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM.
Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.
The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844, but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an "Unregistered Words Committee" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries.
Other important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and e-mail submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.
And so the ''New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED)'' project began.
In 1895, the title ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (''OED'') was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes.
This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.
The first dictionary to include them was the ''Penguin English Dictionary'' of 1965.
New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before.
Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately a third of which is now complete.
A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in ''Time'' as saying "I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline."
However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' obscenity trial in 1960.
They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached.
The online edition is the most up-to-date version of the dictionary available.
Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break).
If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together.
Once ''NODE'' was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' followed, this time based on an abridgement of ''NODE'' rather than the ''OED''; ''NODE'' (under the new title of the ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', or ''ODE'') continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', with the ''OED'' now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.
The price for an individual to use this edition is £195 or US$295 every year, even after a reduction in 2004; consequently, most subscribers are large organizations such as universities.
Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary.
Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean.
The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced.
The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.
The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix ''-ιζειν'', (''-izein''), or the Latin ''-izāre''.
For the suffix more commonly spelt  ''-ise'' in British English, OUP policy dictates a preference for the spelling ''-ize'', e.g., ''realize'' vs. ''realise'' and ''globalization'' vs. ''globalisation''.
In 1991, for the ''OED2'', the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up ("9-up") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary.
Also in 1895, the title ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (''OED'') was first used.
The first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884—twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages.
That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888.
Harris also faults the editors' "donnish conservatism" and their adherence to prudish Victorian morals, citing as an example the non-inclusion of "various centuries-old 'four-letter words'" until 1972.
The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the Philological Society president.
He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report "as many quotations as you can for ordinary words" and for words that were "rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way".
For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for ''abusion'' as for ''abuse''.
It has become a target precisely ''because'' of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes, its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence.
Author Anthony Burgess declared it "the greatest publishing event of the century", as quoted by the ''Los Angeles Times''.
By the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would now need to be computerized.
Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with ''A–D'', ''H–K'', ''O–P'', and ''T'', nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed ''E–G'', ''L–M'', ''S–Sh'', ''St'', and ''W–We''.
The '''''Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''OED''''') is a descriptive dictionary of the English language, published by the Oxford University Press.
The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English.
The OED's claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.
In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the ''Compact Edition''.
*Insufficient use of good illustrative quotations
Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (''NED'').
Burchfield also removed some smaller entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement, for reasons of space; in 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's attempt to include more such words.
The online database contains the entire ''OED2'' and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the ''OED3'' (see above).
While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections.
Individuals who belong to a library which subscribes to the service are able to use the service from their own home without charge.
Many copies were inexpensively distributed through book clubs.
Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the ''Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary'', led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology went on to become the basis for the Open Text Corporation.
Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated.
Version 4.0 of the CD has been available since June 2009 and works with Windows 7 and Mac OS X (10.4 or later).
Robert Burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement; Onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions, as well.
The word "new" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the ''OED,'' or the ''OED2,'' was published.
More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published.
Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics.
Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies.
The ''Oxford English Dictionary 2'' was printed in 20 volumes.
The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus.
Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by marking up the content in SGML.
In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.
The ''Compact Edition'' included, in a small slip-case drawer, a magnifying glass to help in reading reduced type.
The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of ''The Surgeon of Crowthorne'' (US title: ''The Professor and the Madman''), a popular book about the creation of the ''OED''.
His house was the first editorial office.
Version 3.0 was released in 2002 with additional words from the ''OED3'' and software improvements.
In contrast, Tim Bray, co-creator of Extensible Markup Language (XML), credits the ''OED'' as the developing inspiration of that markup language.
The ''OED''s small army of devoted readers continue to contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.
The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.
On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started.
Burchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech.
Some public libraries and companies have subscribed, as well, including public libraries in the United Kingdom, where access is funded by the Arts Council, and public libraries in New Zealand.
To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as "''erroneous''" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the "social biases" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers.
Once the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on CD-ROM.
The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years.
This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period that a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.
Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage.
As entries began to be revised for the ''OED3'' in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became ''make'' in 2000, then ''put'' in 2007, then ''run'' in 2011.
The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885.
This version uses the CD drive for installation, running only from the hard drive.
George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer.
The original edition, mostly based on the ''OED1'', was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.
Similarly, author Anu Garg, founder of Wordsmith.org, has called the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' a "lex icon".
At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d.
The supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the ''OED'' as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition.
In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.
The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor.
Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.
The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages.
They hoped to finish the project in ten years.
''Wordhunt'' was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced antedatings for many.
The 20 volumes started with ''A'', ''B.B.C.
However, ''-ze'' is also sometimes treated as an Americanism insofar as the ''-ze'' suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with ''analyse'' (British English), which is spelt ''analyze'' in American English.
The official dictionary of Spanish is the ''Diccionario de la lengua española'' (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Española), and its first edition was published in 1780.
Gell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns—containing costs and speeding production—to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely.
Version 2 (1999) included the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' ''Additions'' of 1993 and 1997.
Late in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named W. C. Minor was a criminal lunatic.
The ''OED'' web site is not optimized for mobile devices, but the developers have stated that there are plans to provide an API that would enable developers to develop different interfaces for querying the ''OED''.
Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole.
By early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for ''A–B'', five for ''C'', and two for ''E''.
In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.
When the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic.
On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.
Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.
Afterward, three versions of the second edition were issued.
The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database.
Neither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it.
The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the ''Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series,'' a new set of supplements to complement the ''OED2'' with the intention of producing a third edition from them.
*Inadequate distinction among synonyms
He retired in 2013 and was replaced by Michael Proffitt, who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.
The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to maneuver a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public.
Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary.
More than 120 keyboarders of the International Computaprint Corporation in Tampa, Florida, and Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA, started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England.
Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.
The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the ''OED1'' generally tended to be better than the earlier ones.
Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society''.
A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it.
While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, account books, diaries, journals, and letters.
It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.
William Craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for ''N'', ''Q–R'', ''Si–Sq'', ''U–V'', and ''Wo–Wy.''
Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience.
John Simpson was the first chief editor of the ''OED3''.
The text of the first edition was made available in 1987.
However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating "key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them".
Founding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used.
Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.
Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations.
In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study ''On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries'', which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:
The British quiz show ''Countdown'' has awarded the leather-bound complete version to the champions of each series since its inception in 1982.
By 1989 the ''NOED'' project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary.
In the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both Henry Sweet and Henry Nicol to succeed him.
The ''OED'' lists British headword spellings (e.g., ''labour'', ''centre'') with variants following (''labor'', ''center'', etc.).
In 1998 the ''New Oxford Dictionary of English'' (''NODE'') was published.
Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the ''Saturday Review'', and public opinion backed the editors.
While also aiming to cover current English, ''NODE'' was not based on the ''OED''.
*History of obsolete senses of words often omitted
Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips.
In 1933, the title ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement.
The new system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.
With this XML-based system, the attention of lexicographers can be directed more to matters of content than to presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions.
Despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claim of authority on the English language, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has been criticized since at least the 1960s from various angles.
The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four 6,400-page volumes.
Trench suggested that a new, truly ''comprehensive'' dictionary was needed.
The forerunners to the ''OED'', such as the early volumes of the ''Deutsches Wörterbuch'', had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the ''OED'' editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications.
He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.
The first edition of the ''Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca'' is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of ''Dictionnaire de l'Académie française'' dates from 1694.
*Incomplete coverage of obsolete words
The first edition retronymically became the ''OED1''.
The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, feels it unlikely that it will ever be printed.
The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month.
Collectively, the Bible is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is ''Cursor Mundi''.
*Space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content.
Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching&nbsp;– as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text.
Between 1928 and 1933, enough additional material had been compiled to make a one-volume supplement, so the dictionary was reissued as the set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement in 1933.
A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.
Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961.
The results were reported in a BBC TV series, ''Balderdash and Piffle''.
The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full A–Z range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.
Furnivall then became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, yet temperamentally ill-suited for the work.
The OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements.
This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff.
