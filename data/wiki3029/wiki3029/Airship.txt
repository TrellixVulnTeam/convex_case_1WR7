The Empire State Building was completed in 1931 with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of passenger airship service.
Nonetheless, the design represents an approach that may well be applicable to WALRUS.
The ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew some test flights and conducted electronic espionage until 1939 when it was grounded due to the start of the war.
Meanwhile, several ''Zeppelin NT'' have been produced and operated profitably in joyrides, research flights and similar applications.
The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the homing torpedo they had little chance of sinking a submarine.
The most commonly used lifting gas, helium, is inert so presents no fire risk.
Some US airships saw action in the European war theater.
The "capitalist" ship, the ''R100'', was more conventional, while the "socialist" ship, the R101, had many innovative design features.
It made its first flight at Tempelhof field in Berlin after Schwarz had died.
Airships would develop considerably over the next two decades.
These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine.
They were the only airship operator in the U.S. authorized to fly commercial passengers, until closing their doors in 2012.
Often the crew would outnumber passengers, and on the ground large teams were necessary to assist mooring and very large hangars were required at airports.
Operational considerations such as whether the lift gas can be economically vented and produced in flight for control of buoyancy (as with hydrogen) or even produced as a byproduct of propulsion (as with steam) affect the practical choice of lift gas in airship designs.
Early gondolas were open structures slung beneath the envelope, later ones were enclosed and hung directly from the internal framing.
Rarer duties of the airships included aerophoto reconnaissance, naval mine-laying and mine-sweeping, parachute unit transport and deployment, cargo and personnel transportation.

Construction of both took longer than expected, and the airships did not fly until 1929.
Rigid airships may have further passenger or cargo space inside the envelope.
After his approval it was built by the Novelty Air Ship Company.
The advantage of airships over aeroplanes is that static lift sufficient for flight is generated by the lifting gas and requires no engine power.
This was a disaster which theatergoers could see and hear in newsreels.
In June 2004, a Zeppelin NT was sold for the first time to a Japanese company, Nippon Airship Corporation, for tourism and advertising mainly around Tokyo.
Only ''K''- and ''TC''-class airships were suitable for combat and they were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German submarines which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast.
It was also given a role at the 2005 Expo in Aichi.
Only one airship was ever destroyed by U-boat: on the night of 18/19 July 1943, a ''K''-class airship (''K-74'') from ZP-21 division was patrolling the coastline near Florida.
There have been some niches for airships in and after World War II, such as long-duration observations, antisubmarine patrol, platforms for TV camera crews, and advertising; these, however, generally require only small and flexible craft, and have thus generally been better fitted for cheaper (non-passenger) blimps.
The primary goal of the research program was to determine the feasibility of building an airship capable of carrying  of payload a distance of  and land on an unimproved location without the use of external ballast or ground equipment (such as masts).
In 1888–97 Dr. Frederich Wölfert built three airships powered by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft-built petrol engines, the last of which caught fire in flight and killed both occupants in 1897.
The term "gondola" is used to describe a crew car of an airship, slung beneath the centre of the envelope.
These may be short, for cockpit and landing gear alone, or longer to provide passenger space.
This availability declined from 34% in 1915, to 24.3% in 1916 and finally 17.5% in 1918.
The shell may be gas-tight as in a non-rigid blimp, or the design may employ internal gas bags as in a rigid airship.

In both cases, the airships are heavy haulers.
However, on 5 October 1930 the R101, which had not been thoroughly tested after major modifications, crashed on its maiden voyage at Beauvais in France killing 48 of the 54 people aboard.
Modern airships have a natural buoyancy and special design that offers a virtually zero catastrophic failure mode.
The disadvantages are that an airship has a very large reference area and comparatively large drag coefficient, thus a larger drag force compared to that of aeroplanes and even helicopters.
Based on specific lift (lifting force per unit volume of gas), the greatest static lift is provided by hydrogen (11.15&nbsp;N/m3 or 71&nbsp;lbf/1000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) with helium (10.37&nbsp;N/m3 or 66&nbsp;lbf/1000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) a close second.

A hybrid airship is a general term for an aircraft that combines characteristics of heavier-than-air (aeroplane or helicopter) and lighter-than-air technology.
One crew member, who was on watch aboard the moored craft, was slightly injured but released after overnight observation in hospital.
The airships were initially immune to attack by aircraft and antiaircraft guns: as the pressure in their envelopes was only just higher than ambient air, holes had little effect.
Nowadays the term "airship" is used only for powered, dirigible balloons, with sub-types being classified as rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid.
Bland believed that the machine could be driven at  and could fly from Sydney to London in less than a week.
By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS ''Macon'', had been lost.
Aeroplanes had essentially replaced airships as bombers by the end of the war, and Germany's remaining zeppelins were destroyed by their crews, scrapped or handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations.

New designs capable of reaching greater altitude were developed, but although this made them immune from attack it made their bombing accuracy even worse.
Typically the airship has an extended, usually articulated keel running along the bottom of the envelope to stop it kinking in the middle by distributing suspension loads into the envelope, while also allowing lower envelope pressures.
An airship also has engines, crew, and optionally also payload accommodation, typically housed in one or more "gondolas" suspended below the envelope.
In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability.
This allows an airship to reach any altitude with balanced inner and outer pressure if the buoyancy is enough.
This concept used changes in lift to provide propulsive force, and did not need a powerplant.
This makes them easy to carry in trailers or trucks and inexpensive to store.
Their mission was to locate and destroy German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar where magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) was viable.
Internally two ballonets placed in the front part and in the rear part of the hull contains air.
This feat failed to generate enthusiasm for continued airship development, and the British airship program was rapidly wound down.
An impediment to the large-scale development of airships as heavy haulers has been figuring out how they can be used in a cost-efficient way.

The USS Los Angeles was used for initial experiments, and the  and , the world's largest at the time, were used to test the principle in naval operations.
In American usage it refers specifically to a non-rigid type of dirigible balloon or airship.
Semirigid architecture is the more recent and the late appearance is caused by both advancements about deformable structures and exigiency of reducing weight and volume of the airships.
The envelope is the normal cigar shape, complete with tail fins, but is inflated with hot air instead of helium to provide the lifting force.
The US Navy experimented with the use of airships as airborne aircraft carriers, developing an idea pioneered by the British.

In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the air" or "flying-ships".
Both nonrigid ships nevertheless had strong metal monocoque envelopes which, while they maintained their shape uninflated, required an overpressure during flight.

At first multiplane tail surfaces were used for control and stability: later designs had simpler later cruciform tail surfaces.
A non-rigid airship relies entirely on internal gas pressure to retain its shape during flight.
A balloon is to be used for elevating the flying ship, after which it is to be guided and controlled at the pleasure of its occupants.”.
With a non-rigid body and internal bracing wires, it overcame the flaws of these types of aircraft as regards both rigid structure (zeppelin type) and flexibility, providing the airships with more stability during flight, and the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load.
Additionally, there was a passenger compartment (later a bomb bay) located halfway between the two engine compartments.
Examples include helicopter/airship hybrids intended for heavy lift applications and dynamic lift airships intended for long-range cruising.
They also served as an organization centre for the convoys to direct ship movements, and were used in naval search and rescue operations.
