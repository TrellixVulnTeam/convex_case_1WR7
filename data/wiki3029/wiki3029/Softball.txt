In other varieties of slow pitch (sometimes known as "modified"), the only restriction is that the windmill cannot be used; thus the pitching arm cannot be raised above the shoulder and both the wind-up and the release must be underhand, still allowing for moderate speed and control in pitching.
Pitchers can be righthanded or lefthanded.
Then, depending where the runner is between home and first, the second baseman makes the decision to throw the ball to first or to hold the ball.
These extra inches give the outfielders the extra reach to catch a fly ball far away from them.
A female catcher may optionally wear a body protector in slow pitch.
In girls' fastpitch, 12u up to 18u level can throw between 30&nbsp;mph and 65&nbsp;mph, or more.

In fastpitch, the pitcher must have both feet in contact with the pitching rubber at all times.
A well-broken-in ball is called a mush ball and is favoured for informal "pick-up" games and when playing in limited space, such as a city street (because the ball does not go as far).
That is because the player must vacate first base to allow the next batter to reach it, and consequently can only go to second base, where a force out may be recorded.
If it is a championship game, it is replayed from the beginning.
Right field has a particular job of covering the area behind first base if the ball is to be thrown in that area.
Only the wall behind the batter is considered foul territory.
Right field is meant to cover this area is the ball gets past the first baseman.

The formation of the Joint Rules Committee on Softball in 1934 standardized the rules and naming throughout the United States.
Australia has excellent softball teams which are a reflection of its coaching, education and training system.
In this case, the second baseman covers the steal.
Located in foul territory outside both baselines are two 'Coach's Boxes'.
Slow-pitch softball is played with ten fielders.
They will have more momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop.
In fastpitch softball, the pitch is fast, there are nine players on the field at one time, and bunting and stealing are permitted.
The batter is considered to strike out if the batter fails to hit the ball into fair territory after the given number of pitches.
Home runs are usually scored by hitting the ball over the outfield fence, but may be scored on a hit which does not go over the fence.
All over the USA, there are thousands of teams that compete year-round at tournaments.
The infield in softball is smaller than on an adult or high school baseball diamond but identical to that used by Little League Baseball; each base is 60&nbsp;ft (18&nbsp;m) from the next, as opposed to baseball's 90&nbsp;ft (27&nbsp;m).

No part of the glove is allowed to be the same color as that of the ball, including that of its seams.
The IOC funded a landmark bio-mechanical study on pitching during the games.
However, the field can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial turf or asphalt.
The 1996 Olympics also marked a key era in the introduction of technology in softball.
As soon as the pitcher makes a throw, the fielders are ready to field balls that are hit in the middle of the diamond.
Thus, if the team batting first is ahead by enough runs for the rule to come into effect, the team batting second is given their half of the inning to try to narrow the margin.
The bat is held with both hands, over the shoulder, and away from the pitcher (90 degree angle).
When she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a "base-runner" or "runner".
Only decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to be protestable.
The minimum length of the baselines varies classification of play (see below for official measurements).
In the left field position, the player has full view of the field, the players, the base-runners, and the batter.

Often double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the short stop.
Out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist, with a verbal call of "out".
By the 1940s, fastpitch began to dominate the game.
The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders.
An infielder's glove is typically the smallest glove on the field.
It is recommended in lower age groups.
The shortstop only doesn't cover second base when a right handed batter is up.
Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings.
Third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times unless the ball is hit to them.
Rober's version of the game used a ball  in circumference, rather than the  ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed, although the dimensions of the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one.

To the batter, the dropball appears to be coming in level but then as the ball reaches the plate, the pitch drops, trying to force the batter to hit the top of the ball.
As in baseball, fastpitch softball has a rubber used to control the pitchers delivery.
This will prevent base-runners from advancing to unwanted bases.
When a ball is batted into play, runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play.
The rubber can be 40 or 43 feet away from home plate, depending on age level and the league one is playing in.
A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate.
The center fielder needs to be the quickest because of the large area of field they must cover.
Several bats are banned because of the harm it may place upon other teams and/or giving them an unfair advantage.
If the batter reaches four balls, the batter is awarded the first base in what is known as a "walk".
Lastly, painting bats is done because competitors purchase "illegal" bats that are dangerous and hazardous to the opposing team.

These are somewhat padded shinguards that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap all the way around the leg(s).
In fastpitch softball, there are various types of pitches.
After a successful hit the batter becomes a baserunner (or runner) and must run to first base.
In the infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, and third baseman.
While these modified rules are common, there are questions as to their place in modern adult sports.
Some leagues require teams to use limited flight softballs.
For instance, one strike is an out, and two balls is a walk.
Retreating past a made base, negates the advance to that base.
Helmets are optional in slowpitch.
One of the biggest is the Amateur Softball Association, also known as ASA.
When pitchers throw curveballs they snap their wrist and follow their arm across their body, making the ball curve to the outside of the plate.

Catchers must know how many outs there are, the number of strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their team-mates.
The major role of the first baseman is to receive throws from other defensive players in order to get a force play at first base.
In some leagues the number of pitches to walk or strikeout can be reduced.
Similarly, both the dropball and the riseball are pitches that change heights.
These leagues are almost exclusively slow-pitch.
