When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality (when compared to human raters).
Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.
The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.
Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.
*Threshold Theory (TT).
These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.
In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.
A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism.
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key 21st century skills and as one of the  Four Cs of 21st century learning by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.
Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.
Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.
For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands.
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)
This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep.
It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "great men".
Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''.
Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing.
Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important.
Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children.
* they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe.
Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity.
As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.
He used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face.
One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.
This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account.
According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, "the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the ''Genesis''."
A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120.
From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas.
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
The idea must also be appropriate—useful and actionable.
* and Motivation (especially intrinsic motivation).
A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person.
Scholarly interest in creativity involves many definitions and concepts pertaining to a number of disciplines: psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), technology, theology, sociology, linguistics, business studies, songwriting, and economics, covering  the relations between creativity and general intelligence, mental and neurological processes, personality type and creative ability, creativity and mental health; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training, especially as augmented by technology; and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.
(Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.)
The lexeme in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the Latin term ''creō'' "to create, make": its derivational suffixes also come from Latin.
In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.
A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive."
Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.
Wallach and Kogan administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children.
Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system.
However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling.
It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent.
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".
Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.
It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line, related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."
It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses.
It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."
Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy, and thought in general.
Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity.
Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness);
Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&nbsp;110), or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".
These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).
Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature.
There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.
This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity.
Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem.
Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression.
However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.
Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments.
This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.
Much modern day research reports findings against TT.
This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.
However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment.
Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity.
In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.
Perkins referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.
Sleep aids this process.
The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.
This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.
Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself.
Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "daemon" (Greek) or "genius" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine.
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.
This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported.
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects.
From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.
It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector.
The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots.
An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.
The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers.
Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process.
By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent.
Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity.
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed.
The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.
Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed.
It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later.
As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time.
* intrinsic motivation – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.
A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.
in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from ''r'' = .19 to ''r'' = .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were ''r'' = <.12.
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.
There must be balance fit among resources and people;
Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism.
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
This idea was later developed into conceptual blending.
The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise.
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
In 1992, Finke et al.
For example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression.
Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected."
It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.
Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc.
Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.
High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.
Several attempts have been made to develop a ''creativity quotient'' of an individual similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ), however these have been unsuccessful.
Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a.
Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.
Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.
With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.
In the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of ''creative destruction'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new.
However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.
Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God.
The neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour.
proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas.
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.
# Establishing purpose and intention
*PASS theory of intelligence.
A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers.
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
Robinson and Anna Craft have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education.
However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."
Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
* extrinsic motivation – external factors, for example threats of being fired or money as a reward,
Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task.
However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance.
Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other.
# Providing balance
Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs.
Schmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990.
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments.
Nickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed.
The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation (in The Parson's Tale).
# Building basic skills
These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues.
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation.
Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses.
The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea.
Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.
This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.
In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment.
The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e.
This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.
This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex.
This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview.
This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.
* Freedom – giving people autonomy choosing means to achieve goals;
In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process.
Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation.
According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and comedians.
While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity.
The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation.
Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight.
Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward).
Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.
Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.
James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field).
This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects."
that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.
From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.
Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves.
REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible.
There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs.
Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach.
Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on.
Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity.
In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in '''writers''', '''poets''', and '''artists'''.
Asked in ''The Republic'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?
The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.
The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to Mel Rhodes).
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, collaboration.
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data.
Preckel et al., investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over.
* Work group features – diverse, supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
