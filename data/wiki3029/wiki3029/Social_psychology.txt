Social psychology is a discipline that had traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology.
Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.
An ''external'', or situational, attribution involves situational elements, such as the weather.
Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group.
The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20).
They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales.
Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior.
This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true.
An affective (or emotional) question: How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity?
One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first advanced by Abraham Tesser in 1983, is that strong likes and dislikes are rooted in our genetic make-up.
Firstly, questionable research practices (QRP) have been identified as common in the field.
Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning.
This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in love.
In Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task.
Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in health, environmental, and legal psychology.
Person perception is the study of how people form impressions of others.
In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.
In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and European social psychologists.
# The Message, including varying degrees of reason, emotion (such as fear), one-sided or two sided arguments, and other types of informational content.
Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.
By comparison to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem.
In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group.
Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered.
These "selves" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper "self" to process and react on it.
Social comparisons can be either "upward" or "downward," that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability.
There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior.
Note that this study would ''not'' prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.
The need to maintain a healthy self-esteem is recognized as a central human motivation in the field of social psychology.
Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes.
There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.
They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from aggregates:
An ''internal'', or dispositional, attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality, disposition, character or ability.
The Marine contains a "self" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly.
For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize deception to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study.
Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.
Social psychologists use statistics and probability testing to judge their results; these define a significant finding as less than 5% likely to be due to chance.
There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context.
This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.
Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination).
When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.
It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our attention.
); the athlete would be the "self" who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.).
People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.
An unusual kind of social influence is the self-fulfilling prophecy.
One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the Milgram experiment, which studied how far people would go to obey an authority figure.
For example, one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school.
These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups.
This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits.
Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity.
Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means.
Affective forecasting is the process of predicting how one would feel in response to future emotional events.
Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other.
These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful.
Social psychology is an empirical science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field.
They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the behavioral and psychoanalytic schools that were dominant during that time, and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in perception and cognition.
If one partner's costs begin to outweigh his or her benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available.
Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the Stanley Milgram shock experiments on obedience to authority.
Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others.
Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate.
Heuristics are cognitive short cuts.
The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process.
As a generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see group dynamics).
Robert Sternberg has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment.
This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.
Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a "replication crisis" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate.
A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.
An important concept in this area is deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity.
On over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong.
Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.
Furthermore, a process of informed consent is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time.
To protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process.
In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are ''a-schematic'' on that attribute.
The confirmation bias is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.
An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed.
Studies done by Timothy Wilson and Daniel Gilbert in 2003 have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur.
After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including gender issues and racial prejudice.
An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt.
The third major form of social influence is obedience; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person.
The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other.
Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable.
the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine.
For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour, and that the participants' personality influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study.
Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing.
We can ascribe the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors.
Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena, but attribution, social cognition, and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years.
A 2012 special edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology
However, what specifically does self-concept consist of?
A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.
This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.
Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior.
For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.
During World War II, social psychologists studied persuasion and propaganda for the U.S. military.
It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.
Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.
money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as overjustification.
By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis.
* Norms: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g.
One of the most concerted empirical revisitations of the themes raised by Zimbardo came with the 2002 BBC prison study.
If a "self" is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react.
For instance, the fundamental attribution error is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations.
Third, several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis.
Compliance refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person.
One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions, whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.
One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are.
In psychology, '''social psychology''' is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.
Groups often moderate and improve decision making, and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries.
This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members.
Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior.
The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process.
Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.
The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the ''self-schema'', and an evaluative component, the ''self-esteem''.
A second element, attribution, ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors (whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances).
Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library.
To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity.
Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept.
They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task.
The three main areas of social influence include: conformity, compliance, and obedience.
Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.
Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there.
status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual.
Secondly, social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research.
A related trick is the bait and switch.
* Roles: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g.
Persuasion relies on "appeals" rather than strong pressure or coercion.
The second major area of social influence research is compliance.
Social psychologists therefore deal with the factors that lead us to behave in a given way in the presence of others, and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur.
Observational methods are purely descriptive and include naturalistic observation, "contrived" observation, participant observation, and archival analysis.
The terms ''thoughts'', ''feelings'', and ''behaviors'' include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being.
More problematic is the phenomenon of groupthink.
Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.
These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by Daniel Kahneman.
Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups.
In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits.
With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.
Nevertheless, sociological approaches to social psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area.
For example, the scientific journal Judgment and Decision Making has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the unconscious thought theory.
This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.
This was also the time when a radical situationist approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.
The statement that others' presence may be ''imagined'' or ''implied'' suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.
The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., role-playing) should be used instead.
Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.
In just a few days, the "guards" became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant.
The first major area of social influence is conformity.
Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior.
According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called self-schemas&nbsp;– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information.
Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as ''scripts''.
Careful attention to sampling, research design, and statistical analysis is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'' and the ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''.
The first published study in this area was an experiment in 1898 by Norman Triplett, on the phenomenon of social facilitation.
In this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.
Inducing cooperation and superordinate goals later reversed this effect.
A cognitive question: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?
People develop their self-concepts by varied means, including introspection, feedback from others, self-perception, and social comparison.
Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity.
One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man.
Although there were some older treatises about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), the discipline of social psychology, as its modern-day definition, began in the United States at the dawn of the 20th century.
Social psychology reached a more mature level in both theories and methods during the 1980s and 1990s.
In order to do so, they believed that the scientific method, an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.
Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of crowds.
Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity, meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship.
Following the events of The Holocaust in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.
This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error).
This theory is similar to the minimax principle proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not zero-sum games).
A group can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by social relationships.
A behavioral question: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands?
People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered.
There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).
These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon.
Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory.
Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population.
Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader.
This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables.
Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.
However, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation.
However, new statistical methods like structural equation modeling are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data.
The fields of social psychology and personality have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena.
Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study, wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.
Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.
Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy.
Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.
According to social exchange theory, relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis.
Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as conformity, interpersonal attraction, social perception, and prejudice.
Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.
Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.
The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.
# The Audience, including a variety of demographics, personality traits, and preferences.
Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance.
Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.
Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process; these are normally presented in five major categories: ''who'' said ''what'' to ''whom'' and ''how''.
The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.
Careful ethical standards now regulate research.
It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion.
Replications are important, to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance, or some feature of a particular sample.
For these people a range of otherwise mundane events&nbsp;– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach&nbsp;– can trigger thoughts about the self.
The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications
Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.
Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.
Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors, in turn, influence our interactions with others.
A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction.
Attitudes and small group phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era.
