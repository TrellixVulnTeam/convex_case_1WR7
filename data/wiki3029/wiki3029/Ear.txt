Some large primates such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear muscles that are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still large enough to be easily identified.
Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum.
This difference may be as little as 50&nbsp;billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.
The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal.
The three ossicles transmit sound from the outer ear to the inner ear.
The three ossicles bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear.
The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear.
The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup).
This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.
This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone.
Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word "ear" often refers to the external part alone.
Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear.
These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry.
The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear.
Closer to the back of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals.
The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second.
Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.
In some animals with mobile pinnae (like the horse), each pinna can be aimed independently to better receive the sound.
This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window.
The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament.
If they refused, as often happened, the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted.
In Western societies, protruding ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric.
This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.
The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration.
Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing.
It consists of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows.
In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia).
In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.
When a person moves, these otoliths shift position.
Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.
Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax.
Static balance is provided by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule.
The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.
Shh is secreted by the notochord.
The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing.
A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals.
The Vacanti mouse was a laboratory mouse that had what looked like a human ear grown on its back.
Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles begin to differentiate.
The outer ear is supplied by a number of arteries.
The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.
Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium.
The earlobe consists of areola and adipose tissue.
Georg von Békésy was a Hungarian biophysicist born in Budapest, Hungary.
The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound.
The ear may be affected by disease, including infection and traumatic damage.
The inner ear is supplied by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.
The scala media contains endolymph.
When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss.
Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.
This serves as evidence of homology between related species.
A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate the cochlear duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.
The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing.
These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.
Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies.
These anomalies include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18.
Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard as if it were a nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.
These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen in a wide range of animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.
Pointy ears are a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as the French croquemitaine, Brazilian curupira or Japanese earth spider.
Most of the time, it comes on gradually.
Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes on either side of the head.
Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard.
Tinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present.
Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise.
The round window allows for the fluid within the inner ear to move.
The human ear can generally hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range).
After implantation, around the second to third week the developing embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.
A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections.
The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear.
In 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the function of the cochlea in the mammalian hearing organ.
The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals.
The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh.
Most of the genes responsible for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis are members of the homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes.
Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti.
;Molecular regulation
The inner ear houses the apparatus necessary to change the vibrations transmitted from the outside world via the middle ear into signals passed along the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain.
Pointy ears are also found in the science fiction genre; for example among the Vulcan and Romulan races of the Star Trek universe and the Nightcrawler character from the X-Men universe.
It was developed as an alternative to ear repair or grafting procedures and the results met with much publicity and controversy in 1997.
We use the expression "to tweak  (or pull) someone's ears"  to mean "inflict a punishment"."
The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.
The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle ear by the eardrum.
Hence the French expression "se faire tirer l’oreille", of which the literal meaning is "to have one's ear pulled" and the figurative meaning "to take a lot of persuading".
Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.
The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks.
During embryogenesis the ear develops as three distinct structures: the inner ear, the middle ear and the outer ear.
The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.
The ears have been ornamented with jewelry for thousands of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe.
In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and it has been said that it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials.
The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head.
The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.
The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.
Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media.
Hearing loss may be either partial or total.
These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea.
They are a characteristic of creatures in the horror genre, such as vampires.
As the stapes pushes the secondary tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear.
The female cricket fly ''Ormia ochracea'' has tympanal organs on each side of her abdomen.
The ear drum may become perforated in the event of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear.
The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development.
Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty.
Children may also present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation.
The middle ear is supplied by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, a branch of the maxillary artery.
The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.
In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum.
At the end of each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula.
Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common.
When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.
The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations.
Two sets of muscles are associated with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles.
In humans, these muscles have little or no effect.
Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.
Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media.
There are three semicircular canals angled at right angles to each other which are responsible for dynamic balance.
They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information.
The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax.
The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window.
Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct.
The pinna helps direct sound through the ear canal to the eardrum.
The bony labyrinth refers to the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone.
The "ear" was actually an ear-shaped cartilage structure grown by seeding cow cartilage cells into a biodegradable ear-shaped mold and then implanted under the skin of the mouse; then the cartilage naturally grew by itself.
Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles.
The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.
Injuries to the external ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity.
The hollow region in front of the ear canal is called the concha.
Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result in the perception of vertigo.
When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes.
Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph.
The first part of the ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development.
The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm).
Vertigo refers to the inappropriate perception of motion.
This causes the cell to depolarise, and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain.
The inner ear sits within the temporal bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth.
Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear.
Hearing aids work by amplifying the sound of the local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss.
The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid, and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells.
As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.
Only vertebrate animals have ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using other kinds of sense organs.
The occipital artery also plays a role.
The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply.
The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct.
The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue).
They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%).
Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.
Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.
Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.
Sound that travels through the outer ear impacts on the eardrum, and causes it to vibrate.
In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.
There are two principal damage mechanisms to the inner ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells.
Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected.
The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure.
One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss.
Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs of the rest of the ear.
The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus.
It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan.
The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium-rich endolymph.
In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds.
Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli are present in the organ of Corti in the cochlea.
Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea.
The microscopic "hairs" of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid.
The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe.
Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer.
These form bipolar neurons which supply sensation to parts of the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti).
The '''ear''' is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance.
The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone.
The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery.
The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it.
As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.
In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna.
The pinnae have an effect on facial appearance.
All three ossicles develop from the neural crest.
The pinna consists of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal.
Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate.
The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), and the second is exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity).
The human ear consists of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear.
It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone.
The fly uses her "ears" to detect the call of her host, a male cricket.
For these animals, the pinnae help localise the direction of the sound source.
This may be a result of injury or damage, congenital disease, or physiological causes.
Causes of conductive hearing loss include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum.
In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear.
Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle.
The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewellery in numerous cultures for thousands of years, and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations.
It is fully expanded by the end of the 18th week of development.
Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly.
The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively.
The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated.
Unlike structures of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft.
The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament.
The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both.
The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.
Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.
Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise.
Caterpillars may also have hairs on their body that perceive vibrations and allow them to respond to sound.
Simpler structures allow other arthropods to detect near-field sounds.
The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals.
The outer ears develop in the lower neck.
Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
The middle ear lies between the outer ear and the inner ear.
As the cochlear duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media.
Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.
