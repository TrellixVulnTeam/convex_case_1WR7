The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass.
The translation was not perfect.
As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status until 2006.
Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet.
The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers.
:"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them.
For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.
They were known as secondary planets.
In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered.
A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.
Pythagoras or Parmenides is said to have been the first to identify the evening star (Hesperos) and morning star (Phosphoros) as one and the same (Aphrodite, Greek corresponding to Latin Venus).
The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.
Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones.
India uses a system based on the Navagraha, which incorporates the seven traditional planets (Surya for the Sun, Chandra for the Moon, and Budha, Shukra, Mangala,  and Shani for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu.
In his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century.
Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.
Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.
The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space.
When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: ''Mercurius'' (for Hermes), ''Venus'' (Aphrodite), ''Mars'' (Ares), ''Iuppiter'' (Zeus) and ''Saturnus'' (Cronus).
As of ,  known extrasolar planets in  planetary systems (including  multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth, nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun, i.e.
Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems).
Some scientists have argued that such objects found roaming in deep space should be classed as "planets", although others have suggested that they should be called low-mass brown dwarfs.
The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion.
Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs.
This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.
Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.
Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.
Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year.
Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface.
Binary systems of sub-brown dwarfs are theoretically possible; Oph 162225-240515 was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.
Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.
He referred to them as the "Medicean Planets" in honor of his patron, the Medici family.
This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets.
Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets.
Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology.
Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits.
Ceres was subsequently classified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age.
Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials.
Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.
Sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as Cha 110913-773444 and OTS 44, or orbiting a larger object such as 2MASS J04414489+2301513.
This working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals.
Dwarf planet and asteroid
Depending on the accretion history of solids and gas, a giant planet, an ice giant, or a terrestrial planet may result.
The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, ''Ishtar''; Pyroeis after their god of war, ''Nergal'', Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, ''Marduk''.
In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star.
Pallas, Juno, and Vesta
Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted.
Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the definition of planet, and produced one in August 2006.
The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger.
A net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects.
There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed.
One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres.
A protostar forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk.
# Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same isotopic abundance as the Sun) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed).
All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface.
minor planet with a semi-major axis beyond Neptune).
The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the Olympians: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to Cronus, the Titan who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to Zeus, Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to Ares, son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by Aphrodite, the goddess of love; and Hermes, messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.
The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates.
A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate.
After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.
The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it.
In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole).
These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye.
Venus, Mercury and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers.
More than two thousand planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the Milky Way.
The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.
Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium.
This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006.
(The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer generally considered planets.)
The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.
This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star.
As with its equivalents in the other Germanic languages, it derives ultimately from the Proto-Germanic word ''ertho'', "ground", as can be seen in the English ''earth'', the German ''Erde'', the Dutch ''aarde'', and the Scandinavian ''jord''.
The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems.
Steiglitz suggests that this may be a euphemism for the original name of כוכב בעל ''Kokhav Ba'al'' or "Baal's planet," seen as idolatrous and euphemized in a similar manner to Ishbosheth from II Samuel
The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).
In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one.
Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.
With the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than the Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account.
The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity."
There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 days to rotate, and the giant planets only a few hours.
Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars.
The Pythagoreans, in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe.
In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun.
In the 11th century, the transit of Venus was observed by Avicenna, who established that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun.
The accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum.
After much debate and one failed proposal, 232 members of the 10,000 member assembly, who nevertheless constituted a large majority of those remaining at the meeting, voted to pass a resolution.
In ancient Greece, the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called ''Helios'' and ''Selene''; the farthest planet (Saturn) was called ''Phainon'', the shiner; followed by ''Phaethon'' (Jupiter), "bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as ''Pyroeis'', the "fiery"; the brightest (Venus) was known as ''Phosphoros'', the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called ''Stilbon'', the gleamer.
Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction.
Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.
The shrinking star can then become a planetary-mass object.
These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities.
Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars.
This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit.
Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.
These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind.
The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet).
The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object, on the amount of helium and deuterium present.
Regarded as planets from their discoveries between 1801 and 1807 until they were reclassified as asteroids during the 1850s.
Ancient Greeks called these lights  (, "wandering stars") or simply  (, "wanderers"), from which today's word "planet" was derived.
The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or ''year''.
Regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit.
An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438.
Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g.
China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to Chinese cultural influence (such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam) use a naming system based on the five Chinese elements: water (Mercury), metal (Venus), fire (Mars), wood (Jupiter) and earth (Saturn).
Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss.
Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.
There is no official definition of extrasolar planets.
Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.
Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind.
It is almost independent of the planetary mass.
(Smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms.)
In close binary star systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion.
As described by astronomer Steven Soter:
As with Jupiter's major moons, they were known as secondary planets.
Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs.
At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.
The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
Through accretion (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies.
The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the Drake equation, which estimates the number of intelligent, communicating civilizations that exist in the Milky Way.
The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet.
In ancient Greece, China, Babylon, and indeed all pre-modern civilizations, it was almost universally believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all the "planets" circled Earth.
So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.
The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi.
Beyond the scientific community, Pluto still holds cultural significance for many in the general public due to its historical classification as a planet from 1930 to 2006.
The eight known planets and all known exoplanets have π values above 100, while Ceres, Pluto, and Eris have π values of 0.1 or less.
Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.
After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet.
Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse.
Earth has one, Mars has two, and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems.
Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices.
The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets.
The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value.
These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.
The five classical planets, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy.
Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.
Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole, the exceptions being Venus and Uranus, which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.
The odd one out is Jupiter, called צדק ''Tzedeq'' or "justice."
The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known.
Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest.
In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12.
There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores.
Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid.
From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected.
Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus.
A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit.
In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars.
This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal.
The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC.
These theories would reach their fullest expression in the ''Almagest'' written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE.
The four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity.
The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury.
The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation.
Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to the plane of their stars' equators.
Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.
* The ''inclination'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies.
The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust.
Many of the Romance languages retain the old Roman word ''terra'' (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea".
Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet Mercury, e.g.
To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy.
The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure.
Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen.
The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable.
They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU.
Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.
These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.
Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.
# Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).
These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).
Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.
Then, on October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51 Pegasi).
A planet's rotation period is known as a stellar day.
The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre of the planet.
This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets.
For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares.
Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.
The 2006 resolution defines planets within the Solar System as follows:
In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects.
Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System.
Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist among them.
In the 12th century, Ibn Bajjah observed "two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun", which was later identified as a transit of Mercury and Venus by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi in the 13th century.
This means, they always show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.
The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.
The name originates from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon word ''erda'', which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300.
A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity.
+ (Solar) planets 1930–2006
The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is Kepler-37b, with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the Moon.
Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.
In 2003, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement, but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members.
No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets.
The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is no special feature around 13  in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit."
In fact, calculations show that an object fuses 50% of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 .
The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself.
Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.
in the habitable zone.
Many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially Europa).
Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.
At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.
