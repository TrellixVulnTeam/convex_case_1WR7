Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses.
Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
The label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions.
Biological magnification is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons (pesticides) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain.
The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system.
Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides, and products on which they were used are traded across international borders.

Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas.
Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a Toxicity Class.
They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions.
Agroecology also emphasizes empowering people and local communities to contribute to development, and encouraging “multi-directional” communications rather than the conventional “top-down” method.

Most pesticides work by poisoning pests.
Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.
Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop.

A 2014 epidemiological review found associations between autism and exposure to certain pesticides, but noted that the available evidence was insufficient to conclude that the relationship was causal.
Pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of DDT, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain.
One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%.
All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.
However, DDT and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity.

This use of pesticides is so common that the term ''pesticide'' is often treated as synonymous with ''plant protection product'', although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes.
A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.
Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.
