Many of these states - rather than abandoning the reactors entirely - have opted to install an ECCS, develop standard procedures, and install proper instrumentation and control systems.
The ideal is to have reactors that fail-safe through physics rather than through redundant safety systems or human intervention.
# '''Rapid oxidation''' – "The next stage of core damage, beginning at approximately , is the rapid oxidation of the Zircaloy by steam.
It possesses a modest containment building, and the ECCS systems, though not completely to Western standards, are reasonably comprehensive.
The CANDU reactor has two low-temperature and low-pressure water systems surrounding the fuel (i.e.
Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.
*In a loss-of-pressure-control accident, the pressure of the confined coolant falls below specification without the means to restore it.
The containment can be sealed with release of extremely limited offsite radioactivity and release of pressure within the containment.
# '''(Corium) Relocation to the lower plenum''' – "In scenarios of small-break LOCAs, there is generally a pool of water in the lower plenum of the vessel at the time of core relocation.
Catalytic recombiners will rapidly convert the hydrogen and oxygen back into water.
A core damage accident is caused by the loss of sufficient cooling for the nuclear fuel within the reactor core.
This reactor will use a gas as a coolant, which can then be used for process heat (such as in hydrogen production) or for the driving of gas turbines and the generation of electricity.
If the reactor coolant pumps are not running, the upper part of the core will be exposed to a steam environment and heatup of the core will begin.
Thus the ECCS divisions themselves have internal redundancy – and can withstand failures of components within them.
Failures in control systems may cause a series of events resulting in loss of cooling.
Other failure modes aside from fuel melt will probably occur in a CANDU rather than a meltdown, such as deformation of the calandria into a non-critical configuration.
This is a volume of thin steel, perhaps an inch or two in thickness, grossly insufficient by Western standards.
During the 1970s, Finland built two VVER-440 V213 models to Western standards with a large-volume full containment and world-class instrumentation, control standards and an ECCS with multiply redundant and diversified components.
Since the core is liquid, and already melted, it cannot be damaged.
If the water boils away, cooling is lost, but moderation continues.
A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits.
Western light water reactors are not subject to very large uncontrolled power excursions because loss of coolant decreases, rather than increases, core reactivity (a negative void coefficient of reactivity); "transients," as the minor power fluctuations within Western light water reactors are called, are limited to momentary increases in reactivity that will rapidly decrease with time (approximately 200% - 250% of maximum neutronic power for a few seconds in the event of a complete rapid shutdown failure combined with a transient).
It has not been determined to what extent a molten mass can melt through a structure (although that was tested in the Loss-of-Fluid-Test Reactor described in Test Area North's fact sheet).
The alpha-mode failure will lead to the consequences previously discussed.
"'''Core melt accident'''" and "'''partial core melt'''" are the analogous technical terms for a meltdown.
Graphite is also subject to accumulation of Wigner energy, which can overheat the graphite (as happened at the Windscale fire).
During the 1979 Three Mile Island accident a hydrogen bubble formed in the pressure vessel dome.
In some cases this may reduce the heat transfer efficiency (when using an inert gas as a coolant) and in others may form an insulating "bubble" of steam surrounding the fuel assemblies (for pressurized water reactors).
Water is used as a coolant, but not a moderator.
Exposed flammable substances could burn, but there are few, if any, flammable substances within the containment.
After a number of years for fission products to decay - probably around a decade - the containment can be reopened for decontamination and demolition.
*In an uncontrolled power excursion accident, a sudden power spike in the reactor exceeds reactor design specifications due to a sudden increase in reactor reactivity.
The RBMK had no allowance or planning for core meltdowns, and the imminent interaction of the core mass with the bubbler pool would have produced a massive steam explosion, likely destroying the entire plant (vastly increasing the spread and magnitude of the radioactive plume).
However, complete blockage of the core is unlikely because not all fuel rods balloon at the same axial location.
Automatic water sprays will pump large quantities of water into the steamy environment to keep the pressure down.
The RBMK tends towards dangerous power fluctuations.
The melted core is supposed to hit a thick layer of a "sacrificial metal" which would melt, dilute the core and increase the heat conductivity, and finally the diluted core can be cooled down by water circulating in the floor.
In the latter case, due to localized heating of the "steam bubble" due to decay heat, the pressure required to collapse the "steam bubble" may exceed reactor design specifications until the reactor has had time to cool down.
In addition, some have been built with more than marginal containments, some have quality ECCS systems, and some have been upgraded to international standards of control and instrumentation.
Though the cavity is designed to remain dry, several NUREG-class documents advise operators to flood the cavity in the event of a fuel melt incident.
Advanced liquid metal reactors, such as the U.S. Integral Fast Reactor and the Russian BN-350, BN-600, and BN-800, all have a coolant with very high heat capacity, sodium metal.
This is not true of the Integral Fast Reactor model EBR II, which was explicitly designed to be meltdown-immune.
This greatly reduces reactor thermal power (but does not remove it completely); this delays core becoming uncovered, which is defined as the point when the fuel rods are no longer covered by coolant and can begin to heat up.
Due to the enhanced quality control of parts, advanced computer controls, comprehensive passive emergency core cooling system, and very strong containment structure, along with a negative void coefficient and a fast acting rapid shutdown system, the MKER's safety can generally be regarded as being in the range of the Western Generation III reactors, and the unique benefits of the design may enhance its competitiveness in countries considering full fuel-cycle options for nuclear development.
A similar situation occurred during the Chernobyl disaster: after the reactor was destroyed and began to burn, a liquid corium mass from the melting core began to breach the concrete floor of the reactor vessel, which was situated above the bubbler pool (a large water reservoir for emergency pumps, also designed to safely contain steam pipe ruptures).
(This event is less likely to occur in boiling water reactors, where the core may be deliberately depressurized so that the Emergency Core Cooling System may be turned on).
A fire may be caused by air entering a graphite moderated reactor, or a liquid-sodium cooled reactor.
In a pressurized water reactor, a LOCA can also cause a "steam bubble" to form in the core due to excessive heating of stalled coolant or by the subsequent loss-of-pressure-control accident caused by a rapid loss of coolant.
The Three Mile Island accident provided some real-life experience, with an actual molten core within an actual structure; the molten corium failed to melt through the Reactor Pressure Vessel after over six hours of exposure, due to dilution of the melt by the control rods and other reactor internals, validating the emphasis on defense in depth against core damage incidents.
Cooling will take quite a while, until the natural decay heat of the corium reduces to the point where natural convection and conduction of heat to the containment walls and re-radiation of heat from the containment allows for water spray systems to be shut down and the reactor put into safe storage.
An uncontrolled power excursion occurs due to significantly altering a parameter that affects the neutron multiplication rate of a chain reaction (examples include ejecting a control rod or significantly altering the nuclear characteristics of the moderator, such as by rapid cooling).
As designed, it shut itself down, in about 300 seconds, as soon as the temperature rose to a point designed as higher than proper operation would require.
It is also possible that there is already a harmless dense natural concentration of radioactive material in the Earth's core (primarily uranium-238, thorium-232 and potassium-40, which have half-lives of 4.47 billion years, 14.05 billion years and 1.25 billion years respectively.)
In a melting event, one spot or area on the RPV will become hotter than other areas, and will eventually melt.
Hours after the meltdown, concern about hydrogen build-up led operators to release some radioactive gasses into the atmosphere, including gaseous fission products.
Because of the similar densities of the fuel and the HLM, an inherent passive safety self-removal feedback mechanism due to buoyancy forces is developed, which propels the packed bed away from the wall when certain threshold of temperature is attained and the bed becomes lighter than the surrounding coolant, thus preventing temperatures that can jeopardize the vessel’s structural integrity and also reducing the recriticality potential by limiting the allowable bed depth.
Though most modern studies hold that it is physically infeasible, or at least extraordinarily unlikely, Haskin, ''et al'' state that there exists a remote possibility of an extremely violent FCI leading to something referred to as an ''alpha-mode failure'', or the gross failure of the RPV itself, and subsequent ejection of the upper plenum of the RPV as a missile against the inside of the containment, which would likely lead to the failure of the containment and release of the fission products of the core to the outside environment without any substantial decay having taken place.
This model is viewed as having inadequate process control systems.
(See Nuclear power in the People's Republic of China for more information.)
It is safe to say that it might be possible to stop a loss-of-coolant event prior to core damage occurring, but that any core damage incidents will probably assure massive release of radioactive materials.
As such, a molten core is reflective of the normal and safe state of operation of this reactor type.
Since corium is a liquid metal-ceramic eutectic at temperatures of , its fall into liquid water at  may cause an extremely rapid evolution of steam that could cause a sudden extreme overpressure and consequent gross structural failure of the primary system or RPV.
A meltdown is considered very serious because of the potential for radioactive materials to breach all containment and escape (or be released) into the environment, resulting in radioactive contamination and fallout, and potentially leading to radiation poisoning of people and animals nearby.
Restoration of some means of coolant flow will prevent core damage from occurring.
The plant can remain operating with one isolated loop - a feature found in few Western reactors.
Bulgaria had a number of VVER-440 V230 models, but they opted to shut them down upon joining the EU rather than backfit them, and are instead building new VVER-1000 models.
Contemporary safety principles of
Control rods can become stuck if the reactor suddenly heats up and they are moving.
The lower power density of the core greatly enhances thermal regulation.
# '''Uncovering of the Core''' – In the event of a transient, upset, emergency, or limiting fault, LWRs are designed to automatically SCRAM (a SCRAM being the immediate and full insertion of all control rods) and spin up the ECCS.
In 1971, in the article ''Thoughts on Nuclear Plumbing'', former Manhattan Project (1942–1946) nuclear physicist Ralph Lapp used the term "China syndrome" to describe a possible burn-through, after a loss of coolant accident, of the nuclear fuel rods and core components melting the containment structures, and the subsequent escape of radioactive material(s) into the atmosphere and environment; the hypothesis derived from a 1967 report by a group of nuclear physicists, headed by W. K. Ergen.
Many VVER-440 V213 models operated by former Soviet bloc countries have been upgraded to fully automated Western-style instrumentation and control systems, improving safety to Western levels for accident prevention - but not for accident containment, which is of a modest level compared to Western plants.
Rapid shutdown (SCRAM) takes 10 to 15 seconds.
Modern gas-cooled civilian reactors use helium, which cannot burn, and have fuel that can withstand high temperatures without melting (such as the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor).
If the heat from that reaction is not removed adequately, the fuel assemblies in a reactor core can melt.
*In a loss-of-coolant accident, either the physical loss of coolant (which is typically deionized water, an inert gas, NaK, or liquid sodium) or the loss of a method to ensure a sufficient flow rate of the coolant occurs.
(The WASH-1400 report was replaced by better-based  newer studies, and now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has disavowed them all and is preparing the overarching State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses  study - see the Disclaimer in NUREG-1150.)
The VHTR is scheduled to be prototyped and tested at Idaho National Laboratory within the next decade (as of 2009) as the design selected for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant by the US Department of Energy.
Although pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to nuclear meltdown in the absence of active safety measures, this is not a universal feature of civilian nuclear reactors.
Superheated steam and hot metal inside the core can lead to fuel-coolant interactions, hydrogen explosions, or water hammer, any of which could destroy parts of the containment.
Each division (copy) of the ECCS is capable, by itself, of responding to the design basis accident.
This caused the water coolant to flash to steam, causing a sudden overpressure within the reactor pressure vessel (RPV), leading to granulation of the upper portion of the core and the ejection of the upper plenum of said pressure vessel along with core debris from the reactor building in a widely dispersed pattern.
As Kuan states: "In a small-break LOCA with no emergency core coolant injection, core uncovery sic generally begins approximately an hour after the initiation of the break.
Much of the research in civilian nuclear reactors is for designs with passive nuclear safety features that may be less susceptible to meltdown, even if all emergency systems failed.
However, numerous RBMKs still operate.
As such, they can withstand a loss of cooling without SCRAM and a loss of heat sink without SCRAM, qualifying them as inherently safe.
A loss-of-coolant accident and a loss-of-pressure-control accident are closely related in some reactors.
The actual threat of this was tested just 12 days after the release of the film when a meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Plant 2 (TMI-2) created a molten core that moved 15 millimeters toward "China" before the core froze at the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel.
The phrasing is metaphorical; there is no way a core could penetrate the several-kilometer thickness of the Earth's crust, and even if it did melt to the center of the Earth, it would not travel back upwards against the pull of gravity.
This was well below the boiling point of the unpressurised liquid metal coolant, which had entirely sufficient cooling ability to deal with the heat of fission product radioactivity, by simple convection.
* Has six steam generator loops, adding unnecessary complexity.
Refueling is accomplished while online, ensuring that outages are for maintenance only and are very few and far between.
This is because it uses light water as a moderator (rather than graphite), has well understood operating characteristics, and has a negative void coefficient of reactivity.
However, if a nuclear reaction was to occur again within the Chernobyl plant (for instance if rainwater was to collect and act as a moderator) then the new fission products would have a higher specific activity and thus pose a greater threat if they were released.
The only substantial solid barrier above the fuel is the upper part of the core, called the upper biological shield, which is a piece of concrete interpenetrated with control rods and with access holes for refueling while online.
It is quite possible, especially in pressurized water reactors, that the primary loop will remain pressurized following corium relocation to the lower plenum.
Release of the fission products led to a temporary evacuation of the surrounding area, but no injuries.
The first is the bulk heavy-water moderator (a separate system from the coolant), and the second is the light-water-filled shield tank(or calandria vault).
One type of Western reactor, known as the advanced gas-cooled reactor (or AGCR), built by the United Kingdom, is not very vulnerable to loss-of-cooling accidents or to core damage except in the most extreme of circumstances.
Lithuania joined the EU recently, and upon acceding, it has been required to shut the two RBMKs that it has at Ignalina NPP, as such reactors are totally incompatible with the nuclear safety standards of Europe.
Neutronics characteristics have been revamped to optimize for purely civilian fuel fertilization and recycling.
If such a limiting fault were to occur, and a complete failure of all ECCS divisions were to occur, both Kuan, ''et al'' and Haskin, ''et al'' describe six stages between the start of the limiting fault (the loss of cooling) and the potential escape of molten corium into the containment (a so-called "full meltdown"):
A core damage incident can occur even after a reactor is shut down because the fuel continues to produce decay heat.
Liquid fueled reactors can be stopped by draining the fuel into tankage which not only prevents further fission but draws decay heat away statically, and by drawing off the fission products (which are the source of post-shutdown heating) incrementally.
The VVER is a pressurized light water reactor that is far more stable and safe than the RBMK.
Extensive water spray systems within the containment along with the ECCS, when it is reactivated, will allow operators to spray water within the containment to cool the core on the floor and reduce it to a low temperature.
For example, the Browns Ferry fire damaged control cables and required the plant operators to manually activate cooling systems.
As previously described, FCI could lead to an overpressure event leading to RPV fail, and thus, primary pressure boundary fail.
This mode of corium ejection may lead to direct containment heating (DCH).
The term is not officially defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency or by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
These backup heat sinks are sufficient to prevent either the fuel meltdown in the first place (using the moderator heat sink), or the breaching of the core vessel should the moderator eventually boil off (using the shield tank heat sink).
The passive emergency cooling system provides a high level of protection by using natural phenomena to cool the core rather than depending on motor-driven pumps.
CANDU reactors, Canadian-invented deuterium-uranium design, are designed with at least one, and generally two, large low-temperature and low-pressure water reservoirs around their fuel/coolant channels.
# '''Debris bed formation''' – "When the temperature in the core reaches about , molten control materials (1,6) will flow to and solidify in the space between the lower parts of the fuel rods where the temperature is comparatively low.
moderator and shield tank) that act as back-up heat sinks and preclude meltdowns and core-breaching scenarios.
*Byzantine faults and cascading failures within instrumentation and control systems may cause severe problems in reactor operation, potentially leading to core damage if not mitigated.
This is a list of the major reactor failures in which meltdown played a role:
Further, dangerous power fluctuations are natural to the design.
The hypothesis derived from a 1967 report by a group of nuclear physicists, headed by W. K. Ergen.
Many non-EU states maintain V230 models, including Russia and the CIS.
Many of these characteristics are present in the RBMK design, and the Chernobyl disaster was caused by such deficiencies as well as by severe operator negligence.
** However, apparently steam generator loops can be isolated, in the event that a break occurs in one of these loops.
The VVER-1000 type has a definitely adequate Western-style containment, the ECCS is sufficient by Western standards, and instrumentation and control has been markedly improved to Western 1970s-era levels.
In the basement of the reactor at Chernobyl, a large "elephant's foot" of congealed core material was found, one example of the freely-flowing corium.
The containment may be subject to overpressure, though this is not likely to fail the containment.
Furthermore, China does not contain the antipode of any landmass in North America.
As such, pressure stresses on the RPV will be present in addition to the weight stress that the molten corium places on the lower plenum of the RPV; when the metal of the RPV weakens sufficiently due to the heat of the molten corium, it is likely that the liquid corium will be discharged under pressure out of the bottom of the RPV in a pressurized stream, together with entrained gases.
Time delay, and prevention of direct emission to the atmosphere (i.e., containment), would have reduced the radiological release.
The disaster was caused by a power excursion that led to a steam explosion, meltdown and extensive offsite consequences.
During relocation, any unoxidized zirconium in the molten material may also be oxidized by steam, and in the process hydrogen is produced.
However in case of Fukushima incident this design also at least partially failed: large amounts of highly radioactive water were produced and nuclear fuel possibly melted through the base of the pressure vessels.
One scenario consists of the reactor pressure vessel failing all at once, with the entire mass of corium dropping into a pool of water (for example, coolant or moderator) and causing extremely rapid generation of steam.
Western aid has been given to provide certain real-time safety monitoring capacities to the human staff.
However, even with these positive developments, certain older VVER models raise a high level of concern, especially the VVER-440 V230.
The containment could be threatened if the RPV head collided with it.
In a depressurization fault, a gas-cooled reactor loses gas pressure within the core, reducing heat transfer efficiency and posing a challenge to the cooling of fuel; however, as long as at least one gas circulator is available, the fuel will be kept cool.
If the building were to fail and dust was to be released into the environment then the release of a given mass of fission products which have aged for almost thirty years would have a smaller effect than the release of the same mass of fission products (in the same chemical and physical form) which had only undergone a short cooling time (such as one hour) after the nuclear reaction has been terminated.
report that in the event of a steam explosion, failure of the lower plenum is far more likely than ejection of the upper plenum in the alpha-mode.
There are at least two copies of the ECCS built for every reactor.
Nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating fluid via a nuclear reaction to run a generator.
As long as at least one ECCS division functions, no core damage can occur.
The system design of the nuclear power plants built in the late 1960s raised questions of operational safety, and raised the concern that a severe reactor accident could release large quantities of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and environment.
Operator error and a faulty shutdown system led to a sudden, massive spike in the neutron multiplication rate, a sudden decrease in the neutron period, and a consequent increase in neutron population; thus, core heat flux increased rapidly beyond the design limits of the reactor.
The containment building is the last of several safeguards that prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment.
The VVER-440 V213 model was built to the first set of Soviet nuclear safety standards.
The '''China syndrome''' (loss-of-coolant accident) is a hypothetical nuclear reactor operations accident characterized by the severe meltdown of the core components of the reactor, which then burn through the containment vessel and the housing building, then (figuratively) through the crust and body of the Earth until reaching the opposite side (which, in the United States, is colloquially referred to as China).
This is the first stage of core damage.
The Three Mile Island accident was caused by a stuck-open pilot-operated pressure relief valve combined with a deceptive water level gauge that misled reactor operators, which resulted in core damage.
This is the principle of redundancy, or duplication.
Advanced varieties of several of these reactors have the potential to be inherently safe.
This can lead to inaccurate neutronic and thermal power ratings.
Cladding ballooning may block a substantial portion of the flow area of the core and restrict the flow of coolant.
When it melts, corium will pour into the cavity under the reactor.
Release of molten core materials into water always generates large amounts of steam.
At the point at which the corium relocates to the lower plenum, Haskin, ''et al'' relate that the possibility exists for an incident called a ''fuel-coolant interaction (FCI)'' to substantially stress or breach the primary pressure boundary when the corium relocates to the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel ("RPV").
The General Electric ESBWR and Westinghouse AP1000 have passively activated safety systems.
For example, pebble bed reactors are designed so that complete loss of coolant for an indefinite period does not result in the reactor overheating.
Together with solidified control materials from earlier down-flows, the relocated zircaloy and UO2 would form the lower crust of a developing cohesive debris bed."
In reality, under a complete loss of coolant scenario, the fast erosion phase of the concrete basement lasts for about an hour and progresses into about one meter depth, then slows to several centimeters per hour, and stops completely when the corium melt cools below the decomposition temperature of concrete (about 1100&nbsp;°C).
By 1970, there were doubts about the ability of the emergency cooling systems of a nuclear reactor to prevent a loss of coolant accident and the consequent meltdown of the fuel core; the subject proved popular in the technical and the popular presses.
This can lead to rust, if the reactor is exposed to water.
A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point.
According to some, a molten reactor core could penetrate the reactor pressure vessel and containment structure and burn downwards to the level of the groundwater.
One positive effect of the corium falling into water is that it is cooled and returns to a solid state.
Xenon-135, a neutron absorbent fission product, has a tendency to build up in the core and burn off unpredictably in the event of low power operation.
Moreover, any tunnel behind the material would be closed by immense lithostatic pressure.
* Failure of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS).
This is especially a problem in reactors that have a positive void coefficient of reactivity, a positive temperature coefficient, are overmoderated, or can trap excess quantities of deleterious fission products within their fuel or moderators.
These procedures are intended to prevent release of radioactivity.
Though radiation would be at a high level within the containment, doses outside of it would be lower.
The American Nuclear Society has commented on the TMI-2 accident, that despite melting of about one-third of the fuel, the reactor vessel itself maintained its integrity and contained the damaged fuel.
What led to this was an erroneous decision by operators to shut down the ECCS during an emergency condition due to gauge readings that were either incorrect or misinterpreted; this caused another emergency condition that, several hours after the fact, led to core exposure and a core damage incident.
The RBMK does not have any containment above the core.
In 1971, in the article ''Thoughts on Nuclear Plumbing'', former Manhattan Project nuclear physicist Ralph Lapp used the term "China syndrome" to describe a possible burn-through of the containment structures, and the subsequent escape of radioactive material(s) into the atmosphere and environment.
Other types of reactors have different capabilities and safety profiles than the LWR does.
Though this type of reactor is not susceptible to meltdown, additional capabilities of heat removal are provided by using regular atmospheric airflow as a means of backup heat removal, by having it pass through a heat exchanger and rising into the atmosphere due to convection, achieving full residual heat removal.
In the Chernobyl disaster the fuel became non-critical when it melted and flowed away from the graphite moderator - however, it took considerable time to cool.
The Chernobyl reactor was a RBMK type.
By virtue of the relatively inert coolant (carbon dioxide), the large volume and high pressure of the coolant, and the relatively high heat transfer efficiency of the reactor, the time frame for core damage in the event of a limiting fault is measured in days.
*Core-based fires endanger the core and can cause the fuel assemblies to melt.
Whether this extends to automatic initiation of emergency cooling is not known.
This is because the lower plenum of the RPV may have a substantial quantity of water - the reactor coolant - in it, and, assuming the primary system has not been depressurized, the water will likely be in the liquid phase, and consequently dense, and at a vastly lower temperature than the corium.
A prototype of a very similar type of reactor has been built by the Chinese, HTR-10, and has worked beyond researchers' expectations, leading the Chinese to announce plans to build a pair of follow-on, full-scale 250 MWe, inherently safe, power production reactors based on the same concept.
This enables them to inject additional cooling water into the reactor again.
In a loss-of-forced-circulation accident, a gas cooled reactor's circulators (generally motor or steam driven turbines) fail to circulate the gas coolant within the core, and heat transfer is impeded by this loss of forced circulation, though natural circulation through convection will keep the fuel cool as long as the reactor is not depressurized.
Though confinements cannot be transformed into containments, the risk of a limiting fault resulting in core damage can be greatly reduced.
Other types of highly advanced gas cooled reactors, generally known as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) such as the Japanese High Temperature Test Reactor and the United States' Very High Temperature Reactor, are inherently safe, meaning that meltdown or other forms of core damage are physically impossible, due to the structure of the core, which consists of hexagonal prismatic blocks of silicon carbide reinforced graphite infused with TRISO or QUADRISO pellets of uranium, thorium, or mixed oxide buried underground in a helium-filled steel pressure vessel within a concrete containment.
Another scenario sees a buildup of hydrogen, which may lead to a detonation event, as happened for three reactors during Fukushima incident.
Light water reactors do not have flammable cores or moderators and are not subject to core fires.
Subsequent failures can permit these radioisotopes to breach further layers of containment.
*Pressurized Melt Ejection (PME)
By 1970, there were doubts about the ability of the emergency core cooling system of a nuclear reactor to prevent a loss of coolant accident and the consequent meltdown of the fuel core; the subject proved popular in the technical and the popular presses.
Many commercial reactors are contained within a  thick pre-stressed, steel-reinforced, air-tight concrete structure that can withstand hurricane-force winds and severe earthquakes.
Western reactors take 1 - 2.5 seconds.
Present generations of VVERs (the VVER-1000) are built to Western-equivalent levels of instrumentation, control, and containment systems.
If oxygen contacts hot graphite, it will burn.
In this case, sufficient water addition can cool the core and stop core damage progression."
Above , the core temperature may escalate in a few minutes to the melting point of zircaloy  due to increased oxidation rate.
# '''Fuel ballooning and bursting''' – "In less than half an hour, the peak core temperature would reach .
97-99% uptime is a definite possibility.
