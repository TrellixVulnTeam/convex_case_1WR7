Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity.
Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work.
Their tunnels are often open to the surface, encouraging the movement of water and air into the subsurface layers.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1â€“10&nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material.
Lignin undergoes very slow decomposition, mainly by white rot fungi and actinomycetes; its half-life under temperate conditions is about six months.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers.
A soil is called organic if:
'''Cation-exchange capacity''' (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmolc/kg).
It is of use in distinguishing boundaries within a soil profile, determining the origin of a soil's parent material, as an indication of wetness and waterlogged conditions, and as a qualitative means of measuring organic, salt and carbonate contents of soils.
Excessive slope may encourage the erosion of the top layer of soil which holds most of the raw organic material that would otherwise eventually become humus.
The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
They are 7.5% of soils worldwide.
Soil temperature has important seasonal, monthly and daily variations.
Erosion of soil is caused by water, wind, ice, and movement in response to gravity.
Geophagy is the practice of eating soil-like substances.
The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil.
Scientists experimented with adding bentonite, one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil.
Pore size variation also compartmentalizes the soil pore space such that many microorganisms are not in direct competition with one another, which may explain not only the large number of species present, but the fact that functionally redundant microorganisms (organisms with the same ecological niche) can co-exist within the same soil.
The accumulated organic layer called the O horizon produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it.
Rocky silt loam soil under aspen forest
In swales and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced.
The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it.
Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals (the soil matrix) and organic matter, as well as a porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).
More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States.
On the other hand, when monovalent ions, such as sodium, invade and displace the polyvalent cations, they weaken the positive charges on the edges, while the negative surface charges are relatively strengthened.
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached.
On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.
The addition of the raw organic matter that bacteria and fungi feed upon encourages the formation of this desirable soil structure.
Water is retained in a soil when the '''adhesive''' force of attraction that water's hydrogen atoms have for the oxygen of soil particles is stronger than the '''cohesive''' forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.
Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes potassium ions from between the layers of clay such as illite or montmorillonite.
# Soil temperature.
The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities.
#In '''carbonation''', the solution of carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid.
In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation.
Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting soil fertility.
Colloids act to store nutrients that might otherwise be leached from the soil or to release those ions in response to changes of soil pH, and so, make them available to plants.
They are highly weathered, but not as weathered as Oxisols.
Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%.
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients.
Soil organic matter is made up of organic compounds and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead.
This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.
# '''Sesquioxide clays''': old, highly leached clays which result in oxides of iron, aluminium and titanium.
They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate.
Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions.
They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:
Soil structure affects aeration, water movement, conduction of heat, plant root growth and resistance to erosion.
Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''.
As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.
All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.
Silt ranges in size from 0.05 to 0.002&nbsp;mm (0.002 to 0.00008 in).
Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form.
Soil texture determines total volume of the smallest pores; clay soils have smaller pores, but more total pore space than sands.
'''Residual''' soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks.
# preventing damage to desirable soil structure by freezing of saturated soils
Whether these are slow or rapid changes depends on climate, topography and biological activity.
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.
They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates.
The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H+) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH.
Ammonia generated by the production of coke was recovered and used as fertiliser.
All water below wilting percentage is called '''unavailable water'''.
Some nitrogen originates from rain (as dilute nitric acid), but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of nitrogen fixation by bacteria.
The soil mineral apatite is the most common mineral source of phosphorus.
Plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals and improve the soil structure.
:  is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated.
A gram of soil can contain billions of organisms, belonging to thousands of species.

* Phosphorus; very little as its forms in soil are of low solubility.
Clay soils also resist wind and water erosion better than silty and sandy soils, as the particles bond tightly to each other.
This results in soluble acid-base pairs.
There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:
Saprolite is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals.
Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced.
Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH).
For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface.
Within the soil, CO2 concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.
Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be mineralized to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants.
Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays."
The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.
Loamy sand surface soil
Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they weather too slowly to support rapid plant growth.
Wind moves sand and smaller particles, especially in arid regions where there is little plant cover.
In addition, as ants and termites build mounds, they transport soil materials from one horizon to another.
The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.
Climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity, which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil.
Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness.
Evapotranspiration plus water held in the plant totals to '''consumptive use''', which is nearly identical to evapotranspiration.
Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper to the lower layers.
In 2008, three years after the initial trials, IWMI scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields.
Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and colloids are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon.
When soil becomes too dry, the '''available water''' is used up and the remaining moisture is called '''unavailable water''' as the plant cannot produce sufficient suction to draw that water in.
At that point, plants must apply '''suction''' to draw water from a soil.
This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.
Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake.
Soil temperatures affect the anatomical and morphological character of root systems.
The benefit from mulch is to keep the moisture available during the seedling stage.
Little of the soil of planet Earth is older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic, although fossilized soils are preserved from as far back as the Archean.
Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&nbsp;5.5.
Iron forms secondary minerals of a yellow or red colour, organic matter decomposes into black and brown compounds, and manganese, sulfur and nitrogen can form black mineral deposits.
Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects.
Fe2+, Fe3+ (ferrous, ferric)
Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure.
As a result, the clay disperses and settles into voids between peds, causing those to close.
Often called "weathered granite", saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: hydrolysis, chelation from organic compounds, hydration (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include freezing and thawing.
In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of wetland soils may develop.
Once the colloids are saturated with H+, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity.
For example, recently deposited material from a flood exhibits no soil development as there has not been enough time for the material to form a structure that further defines soil.
Lake Bonneville and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples.
Soil contamination at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material.
The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and soil organic matter provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g.
Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&nbsp;Â°C.
Optimum temperatures for tree root growth range between 10&nbsp;Â°C and 25&nbsp;Â°C in general and for spruce in particular.
As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of humin, lignin and lignin complexes collectively called humus.
Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation.
A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, are referred to as a soil horizon.
They may have subsurface zones of caliche or duripan.
Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.
However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials.
The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but no permanent change overall in soil pH.
Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.
Soil is called the ''Skin of the Earth'' and interfaces with lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.
They are: '''parent material''', '''climate''', '''topography''' (relief), '''organisms''', and '''time'''.
The clay particles contain polyvalent cations which give the faces of clay layers localized negative charges.
* Mollisol - soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons.
Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification.
The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed '''suction''' and usually expressed in units of bars (105 pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure.
Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil.
Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate.
They aerate and stir the soil and increase the stability of soil aggregates, thereby assuring ready infiltration of water.
Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.
Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.
Humus refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown.
In addition, the high concentration of salts within plant roots creates an osmotic pressure gradient that pushes soil water into the roots.
The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''.
Desertification is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity.
They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers which describe the horizon in terms of its colour, size, texture, structure, consistency, root quantity, pH, voids, boundary characteristics and presence of nodules or concretions.
For example, the hydrolysis of orthoclase-feldspar transforms it to acid silicate clay and basic potassium hydroxide, both of which are more soluble.
Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon.
In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water.
# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots.
Hydroxyl ions (OHâˆ’) sometimes substitute for oxygen.
They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OHâˆ’), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions.
Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils.
It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil.
Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils.
About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.
Likewise, a deficiency of water is a major factor in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions.
The effectiveness of water in weathering parent rock material depends on seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations.
While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary.
In the United States percolation water due to rainfall ranges from zero inches just east of the Rocky Mountains to twenty or more inches in the Appalachian Mountains and the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
They are carbon '''C''', hydrogen '''H''', oxygen '''O''', nitrogen '''N''', phosphorus '''P''', potassium '''K''', sulfur '''S''', calcium '''Ca''', magnesium '''Mg''', iron '''Fe''', boron '''B''', manganese '''Mn''', copper '''Cu''', zinc '''Zn''', molybdenum '''Mo''', and chlorine '''Cl'''.
By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest.
The substitution of lower-valence cations for higher-valence cations (isomorphous substitution) gives clay a local negative charge on an oxygen atom that attracts and holds water and positively charged soil cations, some of which are of value for plant growth.
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate.
Termites and ants may also retard soil profile development by denuding large areas of soil around their nests, leading to increased loss of soil by erosion.
They are 7% of soils worldwide.
In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter.
While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.
In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition.
At 15&nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called '''wilting percent'''.
In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil.
The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with nutrient-bearing water that carries dissolved minerals from the rocks and guano.
It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them.
After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.
At the same time, roots, fungal hyphae, and earthworms create microscopic tunnels that break up peds.
The soil texture is determined by the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay in the soil.
Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops.
Oxygen in ionic bonds with silicon forms a tetrahedral coordination (silicon at the center) which in turn forms sheets of silica.
In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water.
At extreme levels CO2 is toxic.
Tree roots create paths for rainwater flow through soil by breaking though soil including clay layers: one study showed roots increasing infiltration of water by 153% and another study showed an increase by 27 times.
At that point a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, porosity, consistency, reaction etc.
Soil acidification is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion.
For every 10&nbsp;Â°C rise in temperature, the rates of biochemical reactions more than double.
Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment.
Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers.
Rhizobia share a symbiotic relationship with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment.
The addition of organic matter, water, gases and time causes the soil of that texture to develop into a larger soil structure called an aggregate.

A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&nbsp;square feet (83&nbsp;ft squared).
In 1890 Sergei Winogradsky announced he had found the bacteria responsible for this transformation.
Roots, rodents, worms, and freezing-thawing cycles further break the peds into a spherical shape.
It has very high CEC.
Mica-based clays result from a modification of the primary mica mineral in such a way that it behaves and is classed as a clay.
# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5â€“50&nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges.
Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily quartz particles, ranging in size from  in diameter.
But it is the clay content of soil, with its very high specific surface area and generally large number of negative charges, that gives a soil its high retention capacity for water and nutrients.
Temperature, soil moisture and topography are the major factors affecting the accumulation of organic matter in soils.
In order of decreasing solubility, the leached nutrients are:
Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite.
It has been shown that some monkeys consume soil, together with their preferred food (tree foliage and fruits), in order to alleviate tannin toxicity.
All irrigation water has some level of salinity.
Of all the factors influencing the evolution of soil, water is the most powerful due to its involvement in the solution, erosion, transportation, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.
Soils provide readily available nutrients to plants and animals by converting dead organic matter into various nutrient forms.
