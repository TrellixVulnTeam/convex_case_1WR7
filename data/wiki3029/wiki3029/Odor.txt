In contrast, '''malodor''', '''stench''', '''reek''', and '''stink''' are used specifically to describe unpleasant odor.
This link is an important one, because if an individual associates positive affect (elicited by pheromones),  with a potential mate, their liking for, and attraction to, that potential mate will be increased.
According to the ‘heterozygote advantage’ hypothesis, diversity within the MHC genotype is beneficial for the immune system due to a greater range of antigens available to the host.
Although recently progress has been made, the idea of primary perceptions is disputed, and more so probably the concept of primary odors.

reported, however, that humans can distinguish about one trillion odors.
"Mothers can discriminate the odor of their own child, and infants recognize and prefer the body odor of their mother over that of another woman.
As certain body odours can reflect good genetic quality, woman are more likely to prefer these scents when they are fertile as this is when they are most likely to produce offspring with any potential mates, with conception risk being related to a preference for the scent of male symmetry.
This property is the ability to distinguish different odors and is only descriptive.

Human's remarkable sense of smell is just as good as many animals, and can distinguish a diversity of odors- approximately 10,000 scents.
Indeed, when we find that one perfume or aftershave that works for us, we're hard-pressed to change it - perfume can be as much of our personality as our personal style or likes and dislikes.
The study of odors is a growing field but is a complex and difficult one.
On the contrary, olfactometry is rarely used for immission measurement because of the low odor concentrations.
The human olfactory system can detect many thousands of scents based on only very minute airborne concentrations of a chemical.
Odor perception is a primal sense.
It has also been found that women were reminded more of current or prior partners when smelling odors from men whose MHC was dissimilar to that of the smeller.
A single odorant stimulus type is typically recognized by multiple receptors, and different odorants are recognized by combinations of receptors, the patterns of neuron signals helping to identify the smell.
First a basic description is used such as sweet, pungent, acrid, fragrant, warm, dry, or sour.
This continues until the panelists respond certain and correct twice in a row.
The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of two (i.e.
The sensitivity and ability to discriminate odors diminishes with exposure, and the brain tends to ignore continuous stimulus and focus on differences and changes in a particular sensation.
Unpleasant odors play various roles in nature, often to warn of danger, though this may not be known to the subject who smells it.
Occupants should expect remediation from disturbing and unexpected odors that disturb concentration, diminish productivity, evoke symptoms, and generally increase the dislike for a particular environment.
Their smell perception primarily offers information related to the emotional impact.
To establish the odor concentration, an olfactometer is used which employs a group of panelists.
Without perfume or aftershave, we unconsciously detect people's natural scents: in the form of pheromones.
Odors can become conditioned to experiential states and when later encountered have directional influences on behavior.
Thus, by using a chemical that binds to copper in the mouse nose, so that copper wasn’t available to the receptors, the authors showed that the mice couldn't detect the thiols.
Many methods are used, but all make use of the same inputs which include surface roughness, upwind and down wind concentrations, stability class (or other similar factor), wind speed, and wind direction.

The responses of the panelists over a range of dilution settings are used to calculate the concentration of the odor in terms of European odor units (ouE/m³).
For example, iron-containing metallic objects are perceived to have a distinctive odor when touched, although iron's vapor pressure is negligible.
Standards are hard to set when exposures are not reported and can also be hard to measure.
There are a number of issues which have to be overcome with sampling, these include:
Odor sensation usually depends on the concentration (number of molecules) available to the olfactory receptors.
The most common sources of industrial odor arise from sewage treatment plants, refineries, animal rendering factories, and industries processing chemicals (such as sulfur) which have odorous characteristics.

The odor of cooking processes may be pleasurable while one is cooking, but not necessarily after the meal.
Work force populations vary in levels of discomfort from odors because of exposure history or habituation, and they may not realize possible risks of exposure to chemicals that produce specific odors.
Those taking the contraceptive pill show no significant preference for the scent of either symmetrical or asymmetrical men whereas normally cycling women prefer the scent of shirts worn by symmetrical men.
Higher cognitive brain mechanisms and more olfactory brain regions enable humans to discriminate odors better than other mammals despite fewer olfactory receptor genes.
There is a highly conserved sequence in roughly three quarters of all ORs that is a tripodal metal ion binding site, and Suslick has proposed that the ORs are in fact metalloproteins (most likely with zinc, copper and possibly manganese ions) that serve as a Lewis Acid site for binding of many odorant molecules.
Pregnant women also have increased smell sensitivity, sometimes resulting in abnormal taste and smell perceptions, leading to food cravings or aversions.
Both men and women use perfume to boost their sexual attractiveness to members of the opposite, or same sex.
The study was expanded to include lesbian women; the results were consistent with previous findings meaning that lesbian women were not as responsive to male identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to straight males.
Researchers found that people choose perfume that interacts well with their body odor.
Therefore, the hypothesis proposes that MHC heterozygotes will be superior to MHC homozygotes in fighting off pathogens.
Issues such as temperature and humidity are best overcome using either pre-dilution or dynamic dilution techniques.
The study of odors can also get complicated because of the complex chemistry taking place at the moment of a smell sensation.

Males’ preferences for women’s scent may also change if the woman is taking oral contraceptives.
There are two main odor sampling techniques, the direct odor sampling and the indirect odor sampling technique.
This is due to ''habituation''; after continuous odor exposure, the sense of smell fatigues quickly, but recovers rapidly after the stimulus is removed.
A person's specific threshold before an odor becomes a nuisance depends also on the frequency, concentration, and duration of an odor.
A commonly used technique is to measure the odor concentration at the emitting surface, and combine this with the volumetric flow rate of air entering the biofilter to produce an emission rate.
