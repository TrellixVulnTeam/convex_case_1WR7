Airbus won a greater share of orders in 2003 and 2004.
The company produces and markets the first commercially viable digital fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320, and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380.
Due to lengthy negotiations and disagreements over price, BAE exercised its put option which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation.
It did not cut carbon emissions, but it was free of sulphur emissions.
It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement, it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft.
The A400M project has suffered several delays; Airbus has threatened to cancel the development unless it receives state subsidies.
A shorter, re-winged, re-engined variant of the A300 is known as the A310.
The significant U.S. government support of technology development via NASA also provides significant support to Boeing, as do the large tax breaks offered to Boeing, which some people claim are in violation of the 1992 agreement and WTO rules.
Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (Aérospatiale, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs.
On 1 March 2008 a consortium of Airbus and Northrop Grumman had won a $35&nbsp;billion contract to build the new in-flight refuelling aircraft KC-45A, a US built version of the MRTT, for the USAF.
In recent years the Boeing 777 has outsold its Airbus counterparts, which include the A340 family as well as the A330-300.
Following the 1967 tri-government agreement, Roger Béteille was appointed technical director of the A300 development project.
Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items.
This also confirmed Sud Aviation as the "lead company", that France and the UK would each have a 37.5% work share with Germany taking 25%, and that Rolls-Royce would manufacture the engines.
An exception to this scheme is the A380, whose fuselage and wings are too large for sections to be carried by the Beluga.
The subsidiary Airbus Japan K.K.
It had been formed by a government initiative between France, Germany and the UK that originated in 1967.
In 2009–10, reflecting the increased constraints on bank liquidity across the world, that proportion rose to 33%.
Two months later Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng said that the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's existing 747-400 fleet.
2008-09 (A340-200) 2011-11-10 (all other variants, 377 built)
Thus the British company was allowed to continue as a privileged subcontractor.
Airbus has subsidiaries in the United States, Japan and India.
In the face of lukewarm support from airlines for a 300+ seat Airbus A300, the partners submitted the A250 proposal, later becoming the A300B, a 250-seat airliner powered by pre-existing engines.
In January 1999 Airbus established a separate company, Airbus Military SAS, to undertake development and production of a turboprop-powered tactical transport aircraft, the Airbus Military A400M.

In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split.
North America is an important region to Airbus in terms of both aircraft sales and suppliers.
Airbus Industrie was formally established as a ''Groupement d'Intérêt Économique'' (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970.
A request for funding was made to the three governments in October 1966.
As of 16 September 2008 the Laupheim plant has been sold to a Thales-Diehl consortium to form Diehl Aerospace and while the design activities at Filton have been retained, the manufacturing operations have been sold to British company GKN.

The A318 and A319 are shorter derivatives with some of the latter under construction for the corporate business jet market as Airbus Corporate Jets.
These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support.
With concerns at proposal of the A300B proposal in December 1968, and fearing it would not recoup its investment due to lack of sales, the British government withdrew on 10 April 1969.
However, In early July 2016, US House of Representatives passed amendments that would block Department of Treasury funds from granting licences for export or reexport of passenger commercial aircraft.

The smaller A330-200 competes with the 767, outselling its Boeing counterpart in recent years.
Boeing reacted that if its deal with Iran is blocked by the US Congress, all other companies that supply to its rivals should be prohibited as well.
As a result, EADS chief Noël Forgeard and Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert resigned on 2 July 2006.
Scheduled to be operated by the end of 2010, the 30,000 square metre plant will manufacture composite parts and assemble composite work-packages for the A350 XWB, A320 families and future Airbus programmes.
The decision drew a formal complaint from Boeing, and the KC-X contract was cancelled to begin bidding afresh.
It is based in Blagnac, France, a suburb of Toulouse, with production and manufacturing facilities mainly in France, Germany, Spain, China, United Kingdom and the United States.
Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; Aérospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process.
This solution has also been investigated by Boeing, which retrofitted 4 747-400s to transport the components of the 787.
For example, one version of the A380 has 51% American content in terms of work share value.
Plants at Saint Nazaire, Varel and Laupheim face sell off or closure, while Meaulte, Nordenham and Filton are "open to investors".
Though both manufacturers have a broad product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head.

However, algae and other vegetation-based fuels are still just experiments, and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop.
Airbus, however, has a number of other plants in different European locations, reflecting its foundation as a consortium.
In the mid-1960s, tentative negotiations commenced regarding a European collaborative approach.
Initially the success of the consortium was poor, but orders for the aircraft picked up, due in part to the marketing skills used by Airbus CEO Bernard Lathière, targeting airlines in America and Asia.
Airbus considered several designs, including an odd side-by-side combination of two fuselages from the Airbus A340, which was Airbus's largest jet at the time.
The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true.
Airlines see this as a benefit since they get a more complete product range from 100 seats to 500 seats than if both companies offered identical aircraft.
Given the participation by Hawker Siddeley up to that point, France and Germany were reluctant to take over its wing design.

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders stated that "The only way to do it for big companies is really to create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation... That is what we have started to do but there is no manual...
On 4 October shareholders voted in favour of the sale, leaving Airbus entirely owned by EADS.
However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems.
The A380, for example, is designed to be larger than the 747.
By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.
