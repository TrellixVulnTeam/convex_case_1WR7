Sukarno's political philosophy was mainly a fusion of elements of Marxism, nationalism and Islam.
Others believe that Sukarno and PKI cooperated to kidnap and murder the generals, to forestall a potential Western-backed coup as mentioned in the Gilchrist Document, a view based on Sukarno being in close contact with Aidit and the conspirators in Halim Air Force Base during 1 October.
In April 1961 the Dutch announced the formation of a ''Nieuw Guinea Raad'', with the intention of creating an independent Papuan state.
In early 1929, during the Indonesian National Revival, Sukarno and fellow Indonesian nationalist leader Mohammad Hatta (later Vice President), first foresaw a Pacific War and the opportunity that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might present for the Indonesian independence cause.
In addition to the Javanese language of his childhood, he was a master of Sundanese, Balinese and of Indonesian, and was especially strong in Dutch.
It is believed that upon taking power, the Suharto government deliberately covered-up Sukarno's involvement and sought to solely blame the PKI out of respect of his past services to bring independence to the country, and to protect the integrity of the nation's historic narrative.
On 22 June 1966, Sukarno made the Nawaksara speech in front of the MPRS session, an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt to defend himself and his guided democracy system.
UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for immediate ceasefire, and appointed a Good Offices Committee (GOC) to oversee the ceasefire.
Soon after this rejection, on 29 May, the "Gilchrist Letter" appeared.
The party also advocated secularism and unity amongst the many different ethnicities in the Dutch East Indies, to establish a united Indonesia.
All newspapers, the only radio station (RRI), and the only television station (TVRI) were made into "tools of the revolution" and functioned to spread Sukarno's messages.
To promote nationalistic pride amongst Indonesians, Sukarno interpreted these ideas in his dress, in his urban planning for the capital (eventually Jakarta), and in his socialist politics, though he did not extend his taste for modern art to pop music; he had Koes Bersaudara imprisoned for their allegedly decadent lyrics despite his own reputation for womanising.
On the economic front, there was severe dissatisfaction with continuing economic domination by large Dutch corporations and the ethnic-Chinese.
He embarked on a series of aggressive and assertive policies based on anti-imperialism to increase Indonesia's international prestige.
This period was marked by constant attacks by armed groups on Europeans, Chinese, Christians, native aristocracy and anyone who were perceived to oppose Indonesian independence.
Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received money, weapons, and manpower from the CIA in a campaign known as Archipelago.
Ominously, Dutch soldiers and administrators under the name of Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) began to return under the protection of the British.
Sukarno was still in Bengkulu exile when the Japanese invaded the archipelago in 1942.
Sukarno envisioned an Indonesian-style socialist society,  adherent to the principle of USDEK:
# Negligence of the economy
In Central Java, soldiers associated with the Movement also seized control of Yogyakarta and Solo on 1â€“2 October, killing two colonels in the process.
In Bengkulu, Sukarno became acquainted with Hassan Din, the local head of Muhammadiyah organisation, and he was allowed to teach religious teachings at a local school owned by the Muhammadiyah.
300 British soldiers were killed (including their commander Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby), while thousands of Indonesians died.
As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno's three pillars of support, the Indonesian Communist Party, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam.
British forces began to occupy major Indonesian cities in October 1945.
On the dawn of 1 October 1965, six of Indonesia's most senior army generals were kidnapped and killed by a movement calling themselves the "30 September Movement" (G30S).
Protesting against attempts by the DPR to interfere in military business on behalf of the former-PETA faction of the military, Nasution and Simatupang had their troops surround the Merdeka Palace and point their tank turrets at the building.
There was severe disagreements on future path of Indonesian state, between nationalists who wanted a secular state (led by Partai Nasional Indonesia first established by Sukarno), the Islamists who wanted an Islamic state (led by Masyumi Party), and the communists who wanted a communist state (led by PKI, only allowed to operate again in 1951).
They urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately, while the Japanese were in confusion and before the arrival of Allied forces.
To avoid this menace, Sukarno and majority of his government left for the safety of Yogyakarta on 4 January 1946.
Many sporting facilities such as the Senayan sports complex (including the 100,000-seat Bung Karno Stadium) were built to accommodate the games.
By this time, he had become a popular hero widely known throughout Indonesia.
In December 1930, Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison, which were served in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung.
# ''Demokrasi Terpimpin'' (Guided Democracy)
Inggit was 13 years older than Sukarno.
In some areas the army organised civilian groups and local militias, in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army.
To ensure continuity of government, Sukarno sent a telegram to Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, providing him the mandate to lead an Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI), based on the unoccupied hinterlands of West Sumatra, a position he kept until Sukarno was released in June 1949.
For this writing, he was arrested by Dutch police while visiting fellow nationalist Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin in Jakarta on 1 August 1933.
Smuggling and collapse of export plantation sectors deprived the government of much-needed foreign exchange income.
During the first half of 1950, these states gradually dissolved themselves as the Dutch military that previously propped them up was withdrawn.
Later on, as president, Sukarno remained engaged in architecture, designing the Proclamation Monument and adjacent ''Gedung Pola'' in Jakarta; the Youth Monument (''Tugu Muda'') in Semarang; the Alun-alun Monument in Malang; the Heroes' Monument in Surabaya; and also the new city of Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan.
# ''Ekonomi Terpimpin'' (Commanded Economy).
Sukarno coined the term, ''Amerika kita setrika, Inggris kita linggis'' ("Let's iron America, and bludgeon the British") to promote anti-Allied sentiments.
To follow up on the successful 1955 Bandung Conference, Sukarno attempted to forge a new alliance called the "New Emerging Forces" (NEFO), as a counter to the Western superpowers dubbed the "Old Established Forces" (OLDEFO), whom he accused of spreading "Neo-Colonialism and Imperialism" (NEKOLIM).
Soon after his first visit to America, Sukarno visited the Soviet Union, where he received an even more lavish welcome.
On the security front, the military started a series of effective campaigns which ended the long-festering Darul Islam rebellion in West Java (1962), Aceh (1962), and South Sulawesi (1965).
Faced with this quick turn of events, Sukarno procrastinated.
On 7 August 1945, the Japanese allowed the formation of a smaller ''Panitia Penjelidik Kemerdekaan Indonesia'' (PPKI), a 21-person committee tasked with creating specific governmental structure of future Indonesian state.
His activities attracted further attention by the Dutch PID.
Sukarno's vision for the 1945 Indonesian constitution comprised the Pancasila (''five principles'').
They were forced to build railways, airfields, and other facilities for the Japanese within Indonesia and as far away as Burma.
Sukarno came to resent his figurehead position and the increasing disorder of the country's political life.
This was followed by the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague which led to the complete transfer of sovereignty by the Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to Indonesia, on 27 December 1949.
She left Sukarno and their children, although they never officially divorced.
It was to be led by Major-General Suharto, the future President of Indonesia.
Despite Sukarno's political overtures, which found some support when leftist political elements in British Borneo territories Sarawak and Brunei opposed the Federation plan and aligned themselves with Sukarno, Malaysia was established in September 1963.
Sukarno also hoped that Japan would commence a war against the western powers and that Java could then gain its independence with Japan's aid.
Tan Malaka, a communist politician, organised these groups into a united front called the ''Persatoean Perdjoangan'' (PP).
Claiming that Western-style parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia, he called for a system of "guided democracy."
By the end of 1958, the rebels have been militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered in August 1961.
Sukarno's policy of economic nationalism was strengthened by the issuance Presidential Directive No.
# Democracy, which Sukarno believed has always been in the blood of Indonesians through the practice of consensus-seeking (''musyawarah untuk mufakat''), an Indonesian-style democracy different from Western-style liberalism
A similar regional military movement took control of North Sulawesi in March 1957.
Sukarno again escaped injury.
The Islamic clerics, who were mostly landowners, felt threatened by PKI's land confiscation actions (''aksi sepihak'') in the countryside and by the communist campaign against the "seven village devils", a term used for landlords or better-off farmers (similar to the anti-kulak campaign in Stalinist era).
On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had been listening to Western radio broadcasts.
Faced with this serious challenge to the unity of the republic, Sukarno declared martial law (''Staat van Oorlog en Beleg'') on 14 March 1957.
In early October 1965, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes since those who were shot were veteran military officers.
PKI had become the strongest party in Indonesia.
He was also quite comfortable in German, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, all of which were taught at his HBS.
Sukarno, after successfully influencing Sudirman, managed to secure the release of Sjahrir and the arrest of Tan Malaka and other PP leaders.
Among those killed was Ahmad Yani, while Nasution narrowly escaped, but the movement kidnapped First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean, his military aide; presumably mistaking him for General Nasution in the darkness.
The aim of these organisations were to galvanise popular support for recruitment of ''romusha'' forced labor, requisitioning of food products, and to promote pro-Japanese and anti-Western sentiments amongst Indonesians.
Sukarno also sympathised with the communists' revolutionary ideals, which were similar to his own.
Author Pramoedya Ananta Toer once wrote "Sukarno was the only Asian leader of the modern era able to unify people of such differing ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds without shedding a drop of blood."
He died of kidney failure in Jakarta Army Hospital on 21 June 1970 at age 69.
The military and nationalists were growing wary of Sukarno's close alliance with communist China, which they thought compromised Indonesia's sovereignty.
On the following day, 18 August, PPKI declared the basic governmental structure of the new Republic of Indonesia:
The early 1960s saw Sukarno veering Indonesia to the left by providing support and protection to the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) at the expense of the military and Islamists.
The impressive military victories over the PRRI-Permesta rebels and the popular nationalisation of Dutch companies left Sukarno in a very strong position.
By 2 October, Suharto's soldiers occupied Halim Air Force Base, after a short gunfight.
Sukarno spoke increasingly of a Beijing-Jakarta axis, which would be the core of a new anti-imperialist world organization, the CONEFO.
Sukarno was appointed as head of BPUPKI and was tasked to lead discussion to prepare the basis of a future Indonesian state.
There, he and his assistant Sajoeti Melik prepared the text of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence.
Most of the government budget was spent on the military, resulting in deterioration of infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports, and other public facilities.
Sukarno's decision to negotiate with the Dutch was met with strong opposition by various Indonesian factions.
The purge spread across the country with the worst massacres in Java and Bali.
By utilizing regional officers that remained loyal to Jakarta, Nasution organized a series of "regional coups" which ousted the dissident commanders in North Sumatra (Colonel Maludin Simbolon) and South Sumatra (Colonel Barlian) by December 1957.
The U.S. at the time considered Sukarno one of the "foremost collaborationist leaders."
They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara who were opposed to growing influence of communists.
Hatta's retirement sent a shockwave across Indonesia, particularly among the non-Javanese ethnicities, who viewed Hatta as their representative in a Javanese-dominated government.
The Indonesian parliament, founded on the basis of this original (and subsequently revised) constitution, proved all but ungovernable.
In August of that year, Sukarno broke off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands over the continuing failure to commence talks on the future of Netherlands New Guinea, as was agreed at the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev paid a return visit to Jakarta and Bali in 1960, where he awarded Sukarno with the Lenin Peace Prize.
A meeting of Sukarno's full cabinet was held at the Merdeka Palace on 11 March 1966.
In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta.
He also stated his support for the establishment of "fifth force" of armed peasants and labor.
Sukarno was of Javanese and Balinese descent.
After a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy, Sukarno established an autocratic system called "Guided Democracy" in 1957 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions which were threatening the survival of the diverse and fractious country.
On 4 July 1946, military units linked with PP kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir who was visiting Yogyakarta.
After the fall of Suharto in 1998, some of his opponents theorise that Suharto orchestrated the assassinations to remove potential rivals for the presidency.
The members of various militia groups formed during Japanese occupation such as the disbanded PETA and Heiho, at that time were encouraged to join the BKRâ€”''Badan Keamanan Rakjat'' (The People's Security Organization)â€”itself a subordinate of the "War Victims Assistance Organization".
In February 1962 US Attorney General Robert Kennedy travelled to the Netherlands and informed the government that the United States would not support the Netherlands in an armed conflict with Indonesia.
# Social justice for all Indonesians
By mid-1945 these units numbered around two million, and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java.
Shootouts broke out with alarming regularity in Jakarta, including an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Sjahrir by Dutch gunmen.
However, even with his formally reduced role, he commanded a good deal of moral authority as Father of the Nation.
He then directed military incursions into the half-island, which he referred to as West Irian.
After making another unsuccessful accountability speech (Nawaksara Addendum) on 10 January 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his president-for-life title by MPRS on 12 March 1967, in a session chaired by his former ally, Nasution.
This returned government control over key cities of Medan and Palembang.
Towards the end of his rule, Sukarno's lack of interest in economics created a distance between himself and the Indonesian people, who were suffering economically.
To weaken the influence of the military, Sukarno rescinded martial law (which gave wide-ranging powers to the military) in 1963.
In March 1943, the Japanese formed a new organisation called ''Poesat Tenaga Rakjat'' (POETERA/ Center of People's Power) under Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, and KH Mas Mansjoer.
In recent decades, his grave has been a significant venue in the network of places that Javanese visit on ziarah and for some is of equal significance to those of the Wali Sanga.
The Japanese, on the other hand, needed Indonesia's manpower and natural resources to help its war effort.
Later, while a student in Bandung, he immersed himself in European, American, Nationalist, communist, and religious political philosophy, eventually developing his own political ideology of Indonesian-style socialist self-sufficiency.
In May 1964, Sukarno banned activities of ''Manifesto Kebudajaan'' (Manikebu), an association of artists and writers which included prominent Indonesian writers such as Hans Bague Jassin and Wiratmo Soekito, who were also dismissed from their jobs.
Deteriorating transportation infrastructure and poor harvests caused food shortages in many places.
Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness.
The small industrial sector languished and only produced at 20% capacity due to lack of investment.
In February 1966, Sukarno reshuffled his cabinet, sacking Nasution as Defence Minister and abolishing his position of armed forces chief of staff, but Nasution refused to step down.
The Republican government were willing to cooperate with regards to the release and repatriation of Allied civilian and military POWs, setting-up the Committee for the Repatriation of Japanese and Allied Prisoners of Wars and Internees (''Panitia Oeroesan Pengangkoetan Djepang dan APWI''/POPDA) for this purpose.
These bloody incidences continued until late 1945 to early 1946, and begin to peter-out as Republican authorities begin to exert and consolidate control.
He he blamed this for the deep poverty and low levels of education of Indonesian people under the Dutch.
Meanwhile, Sukarno saw the PKI as the best-organised and ideologically solid party in Indonesia, and a useful conduit to gain more military and financial aid from Communist Bloc countries.
On 29 April 1945, with the fall of Philippines to American hands, the Japanese allowed for the establishment of ''Badan Penjelidik Oesaha-oesaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia'' (BPUPKI), a quasi-legislature consisting of 67 representatives from most ethnic groups in Indonesia.
In Dutch-occupied West Java, Darul Islam guerrillas under Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo maintained their anti-Dutch resistance and repealed any loyalty to the Republic; they caused a bloody insurgency in West Java and other areas in the first decades of independence.
After withdrawing Indonesia from the "imperialist-dominated" United Nations in January 1965, Sukarno sought to establish a competitor organization to the UN called the Conference of New Emerging Forces (CONEFO) with support from China, who at that time was not yet a member of United Nations.
He became romantically involved with Fatmawati, which he justified by stating the inability of Inggit Garnasih to produce children during their almost 20-year marriage.
Eager to pull out its soldiers from Indonesia, the British allowed for large-scale infusion of Dutch forces into the country throughout 1946.
In 1954, Sukarno married Hartini, a 30-year-old widow from Salatiga, whom he met during a reception.
The first years of parliamentary democracy proved to be very unstable for Indonesia.
# Civilised and just humanity
To resist Dutch attempts to regain control of the country, Sukarno's strategy was to seek international recognition and support for the new Indonesian Republic, in view of the relative military weakness of the Republic compared with British and Dutch military power.
The Republic was now under strong Dutch military stranglehold, with the Dutch military occupying West Java, and the northern coast of Central Java and East Java, along with the key productive areas of Sumatra.
They declared a series of military councils which were to run their respective areas and refused to accept orders from Jakarta.
His speech, however, received wide coverage by the press, and due to strong pressure from the liberal elements in both Netherlands and Dutch East Indies, Sukarno was released early on 31 December 1931.
As the mediator of the three groups under the NASAKOM system, Sukarno displayed greater sympathies to the communists.
Unbeknownst to the guests, atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese were preparing for surrender.
With Soviet armaments and advisors, Sukarno planned a large-scale air- and seaborne invasion of the Dutch military headquarters of Biak for August 1962, called ''Operasi Djajawidjaja''.

These programmes received widespread popular support, including from armed forces commander General Sudirman.
In 1960, he declared his government to be based on Nasakom, a union of the three ideological strands present in Indonesian society: ''nasionalisme'' (nationalism), ''agama'' (religions), and ''komunisme'' (communism).
He said that it was too difficult to change his signature, so still wrote it with an "oe".
Eventually, Sukarno and other key PNI leaders were arrested on 29 December 1929 by Dutch colonial authorities in a series of raids throughout Java.
Their demand to Sukarno was that the current DPR be dismissed.

As a reconciliatory move, Sukarno invited the leaders of the regional councils to Jakarta on 10â€“14 September 1957, to attend a National Conference (''Musjawarah Nasional''), which failed to bring a solution to the crisis.
In order to increase Indonesia's prestige, Sukarno supported and won the bid for the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta.
Tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when PKI chairman Aidit called for the formation of a "fifth armed force" consisting of armed peasants and labor.
However, during his imprisonment, PNI had been splintered by oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension.

These forces fought with British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent state of Malaysia.
Murba was a Trotskyite party whose ideology was antagonistic to PKI's orthodox line of Marxism.
To make amends for CIA involvement in the PRRI-Permesta rebellion, US President Kennedy invited Sukarno to Washington, D.C. and provided Indonesia with billions of dollars in civilian and military aid.
Hatta cabinet's policy of rationalising the armed forces by demobilising large numbers of armed groups that proliferated the Republican areas, also caused severe disaffection.
Sukarno approved this idea and publicly called for the immediate formation of such a force on 17 May 1965.
Among its members was future politician Frans Seda.
Six children were killed, but Sukarno did not suffer any serious wounds.
This policy resulted in massive relocation of the rural ethnic-Chinese population to urban areas, and approximately 100,000 chose to return to China.

In 1960 Sukarno began an aggressive foreign policy to secure Indonesian territorial claims.
# Social justice, a form of populist socialism in economics with Marxist-style opposition to free capitalism.
The party advocated independence for Indonesia, and opposed imperialism and capitalism because it opined that both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people.
To face the dissident regional commanders, Sukarno and Army Chief Nasution decided to take drastic steps following the failure of ''Musjawarah Nasional''.
From 1964 until early 1966, a limited number of Indonesian soldiers, civilians, and Malaysian communist guerillas were sent into North Borneo and the Malay Peninsula.

In 1961, Sukarno established another political alliance, called the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM, in Indonesia known as Gerakan Non-Blok, GNB) with Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India's Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia's President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana's President Kwame Nkrumah, in an action called The Initiative of Five (Sukarno, Nkrumah, Nasser, Tito, and Nehru).
The most serious cases were the Social Revolutions in Aceh and North Sumatra, where large numbers of Acehnese and Malay aristocrats were killed by Islamic groups (in Aceh) and communist-led mobs (in North Sumatra), and the "Three Regions Affair" in northwestern coast of Central Java where large numbers of Europeans, Chinese, and native aristocrats were butchered by mobs.

After securing control over West Irian/West Papua, Sukarno then opposed the British-supported establishment of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, claiming that it was a neo-colonial plot by the British to undermine Indonesia.
For this cause, Nasution and Simatupang also mobilized civilian protesters.
# ''Undang-Undang Dasar '45'' (Constitution of 1945)
According to this treaty, the Dutch released the Republican leadership and returned the area surrounding Yogyakarta to Republican control in June 1949.
Consequently, the Dutch were forced to sign the Roem-van Roijen Agreement on 7 May 1949.
