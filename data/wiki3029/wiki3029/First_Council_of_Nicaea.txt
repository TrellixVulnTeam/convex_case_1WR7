When first informed of the unrest in Alexandria due to the Arian disputes, he was "greatly troubled" and, "rebuked" both Arius and Bishop Alexander for originating the disturbance and allowing it to become public.
Basil over the Nicene Creed.
: 20. prohibition of kneeling on Sundays and during the Pentecost (the fifty days commencing on Easter).
Thus, said the Arians, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; and therefore there was a time that He had no existence.
In addressing the opening of the council, he "exhorted the Bishops to unanimity and concord" and called on them to follow the Holy Scriptures with: "Let, then, all contentious disputation be discarded; and let us seek in the divinely-inspired word the solution of the questions at issue."
Thus, the Father was always a Father, and both Father and Son existed always together, eternally, co-equally and con-substantially.
According to surviving accounts, the presbyter Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was created as an act of the Father's will, and therefore that the Son was a creature made by God, begotten directly of the infinite, eternal God.
On the basis of that precedent, the council recognized Alexandria's ancient jurisdiction over a few provinces in the Diocese of Oriens, a diocese that was otherwise administered from Antioch.
Christians, these thinkers argued, should abandon the custom of relying on Jewish informants and instead do their own computations to determine which month should be styled Nisan, setting Easter within this independently computed, Christian Nisan, which would always locate the festival after the equinox.
The word ''homoousia'', in particular, was initially disliked by many bishops because of its associations with Gnostic heretics (who used it in their theology), and because their heresies had been condemned at the 264–268 Synods of Antioch.
However, Nicene Christianity did not become the state religion of the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380.
The position being that the Son had a beginning, and that only the Father has no beginning.
Great leaders such as Eustathius of Antioch, Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius, and Marcellus of Ancyra all adhered to the Homoousian position.
This first ecumenical council was the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, although previous councils, including the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem, had met before to settle matters of dispute.
Constantine organized the Council along the lines of the Roman Senate.
This geographic issue related to Canon 6 was highlighted by Protestant writer, Timothy F. Kauffman, as a correction to the anachronism created by the assumption that each bishop was already presiding over a whole diocese at the time of the council.
Clergy ordained by Meletius were ordered to yield precedence to those ordained by Alexander, and they were not to do anything without the consent of Bishop Alexander.
Greek words like "essence" (''ousia''), "substance" (''hypostasis''), "nature" (''physis''), "person" (''prosopon'') bore a variety of meanings drawn from pre-Christian philosophers, which could not but entail misunderstandings until they were cleared up.
At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new temples and tolerated traditional sacrifices.
Arians saw these as essentially the same; followers of Alexander did not.
Many of the assembled fathers—for instance, Paphnutius of Thebes, Potamon of Heraclea and Paul of Neocaesarea—had stood forth as confessors of the faith and came to the council with the marks of persecution on their faces.
They argued that contemporary Jews were identifying the wrong lunar month as the month of Nisan, choosing a month whose 14th day fell before the spring equinox.
The text of this profession of faith is preserved in a letter of Eusebius to his congregation, in Athanasius, and elsewhere.
The "Zonaras proviso", the claim that Easter must always follow Nisan 14 in the Hebrew calendar, was not formulated until after some centuries.
No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies.
Similarly, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis of Nice also agreed, except for the certain statements.
Some distinctive elements in the Nicene Creed, perhaps from the hand of Hosius of Cordova, were added, some specifically to counter the Arian point of view.
They declared, as did Athanasius,  that the Son had no beginning, but had an "eternal derivation" from the Father, and therefore was co-eternal with him, and equal to God in all aspects.
Derived from Greek (), "ecumenical" means "worldwide" but generally is assumed to be limited to the known inhabited Earth,  and at this time in history is synonymous with the Roman Empire; the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are Eusebius' ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 around 338, which states "he convoked an Ecumenical Council" () and the Letter in 382 to Pope Damasus I and the Latin bishops from the First Council of Constantinople.
This number 318 is preserved in the liturgies of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.
In the event of the death of a non-Meletian bishop or ecclesiastic, the vacant see might be given to a Meletian, provided he was worthy and the popular election were ratified by Alexander.
After a month of discussion, on June 19, there were only two left: Theonas of Marmarica in Libya, and Secundus of Ptolemais.
In these discussions, some dominant figures were Arius, with several adherents.
But when some of the more shocking passages from his writings were read, they were almost universally seen as blasphemous."
He also provided and furnished a "great hall ... in the palace" as a place for discussion so that the attendees "should be treated with becoming dignity".
In the summer of 325, the bishops of all provinces were summoned to Nicaea, a place reasonably accessible to many delegates, particularly those of Asia Minor, Georgia, Armenia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Greece, and Thrace.
One purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements arising from within the Church of Alexandria over the nature of the Son in his relationship to the Father: in particular, whether the Son had been 'begotten' by the Father from his own being, and therefore having no beginning, or else created out of nothing, and therefore having a beginning.
Delegates came from every region of the Roman Empire, including Britain.
Kneeling was considered most appropriate to penitential prayer, as distinct from the festive nature of Eastertide and its remembrance every Sunday.
Later in his reign, he gave orders for the pillaging and the tearing down of Roman temples.
In the short-term, however, the council did not completely solve the problems it was convened to discuss and a period of conflict and upheaval continued for some time.
At the time of the council, he was the confidant of the emperor in all Church matters.
Arius taught that the Son had a beginning, and that he possessed neither the eternity nor the true divinity of the Father, but was rather made "God" only by the Father's permission and power, and that the Son was rather the very first and the most perfect of God's creatures.
The Creed was amended to a new version by the First Council of Constantinople in 381.
According to this interpretation, the canon shows the role the Bishop of Rome had when he, by his authority, confirmed the jurisdiction of the other patriarchs—an interpretation which is in line with the Roman Catholic understanding of the Pope.
The disagreements sprang from different ideas about the God-head and what it meant for Jesus to be his son.
In a circular letter, he announced the accomplished unity of practice by the whole Church in the date of the celebration of Christian Passover (Easter).
It was presided over by Hosius, bishop of Corduba who was in communion with the See of Rome.
Historically significant as the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, the Council was the first occasion where the technical aspects of Christology were discussed.
Yet those assumptions have since been proven false.
The First Council of Nicaea was the first ecumenical council of the Church.
The significance of this clause, however, is extremely ambiguous as to the extent in which Jesus Christ and God The Father are "of one being", and the issues it raised would be seriously controverted in the future.
In Rome, for example, the Apostles' Creed was popular, especially for use in Lent and the Easter season.
Athanasius of Alexandria, a young deacon and companion of Bishop Alexander of Alexandria, was among the assistants.
He did commission fifty Bibles in 331 for use in the churches of Constantinople, itself still a new city.
The Arian controversy arose in Alexandria when the newly reinstated presbyter Arius began to spread doctrinal views that were contrary to those of his bishop, St. Alexander of Alexandria.
On July 25, 325, in conclusion, the fathers of the council celebrated the Emperor's twentieth anniversary.
Today, most scholars think that the Creed is derived from the baptismal creed of Jerusalem, as Hans Lietzmann proposed.
In Nicaea, questions regarding the Holy Spirit were left largely unaddressed until after the relationship between the Father and the Son was settled around the year 362.
Alexander of Constantinople, then a presbyter, was also present as representative of his aged bishop.
In spite of his sympathy for Arius, Eusebius of Caesarea adhered to the decisions of the council, accepting the entire creed.
According to legendary accounts, debate became so heated that at one point, Arius was struck in the face by Nicholas of Myra, who would later be canonized.
This was the first general council in the history of the Church since the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem, the Apostolic council having established the conditions upon which Gentiles could join the Church.
At the end of the creed came a list of anathemas, designed to repudiate explicitly the Arians' stated claims.
This profession of faith was adopted by all the bishops "but two from Libya who had been closely associated with Arius from the beginning".
The Emperor carried out his earlier statement: everybody who refused to endorse the Creed would be exiled.
Arians and Meletians soon regained nearly all of the rights they had lost, and consequently, Arianism continued to spread and to cause division in the Church during the remainder of the fourth century.
However, Protestant and Roman Catholic interpretations have historically assumed that some or all of the bishops identified in the canon were presiding over their own dioceses at the time of the Council—the Bishop of Rome over the Diocese of Italy, as Schaff suggested, the Bishop of Antioch over the Diocese of Oriens, as Loughlin suggested, and the Bishop of Alexandria over the Diocese of Egypt, as suggested by Karl Josef von Hefele.
Eusebius of Caesarea counted more than 250, Athanasius of Alexandria counted 318, and Eustathius of Antioch estimated "about 270" (all three were present at the council).
The suppression of the Meletian schism, an early breakaway sect, was another important matter that came before the Council of Nicaea.
In his farewell address, Constantine informed the audience how averse he was to dogmatic controversy; he wanted the Church to live in harmony and peace.
"The emperor gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties" and "deferred" to the decision of the bishops.
Standing was the normative posture for prayer at this time, as it still is among the Eastern Christians.
Although the most vocal of anti-Arians, the Homoousians (from the Koine Greek word translated as "of same substance" which was condemned at the Council of Antioch in 264–268), were in the minority, the Creed was accepted by the council as an expression of the bishops' common faith and the ancient faith of the whole Church.
For some time, scholars thought that the original Nicene Creed was based on this statement of Eusebius.
Its main accomplishments were settlement of the Christological issue of the nature of the Son of God and his relationship to God the Father, the construction of the first part of the Creed of Nicaea, establishing uniform observance of the date of Easter, and promulgation of early canon law.
Melitius retained his episcopal title, but the ecclesiastics ordained by him were to receive again the Laying on of hands, the ordinations performed by Meletius being therefore regarded as invalid.
Arius believed that the Son of God was capable of His own free will of right and wrong, and that "were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being", and that He was under God the Father.
Eusebius of Nicomedia probably gave the welcoming address.
The works of Arius were ordered to be confiscated and consigned to the flames, while his supporters considered as "enemies of Christianity".
The Arians appealed to Scripture, quoting biblical statements such as "the Father is greater than I", and also that the Son is "firstborn of all creation".
Nor did the Council decree that Easter must never coincide with Nisan 14 (the first Day of Unleavened Bread, now commonly called "Passover") in the Hebrew calendar.
In particular, the Council did not seem to decree that Easter must fall on Sunday.
Over a century earlier the term "Trinity" ('''' in Greek; ''trinitas'' in Latin) was used in the writings of Origen (185–254) and Tertullian (160–220), and a general notion of a "divine three", in some sense, was expressed in the second century writings of Polycarp, Ignatius, and Justin Martyr.
To determine which lunar month was to be designated as Nisan, Christians relied on the Jewish community.
Most significantly, it resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed.
Eustathius of Antioch was deposed and exiled in 330.
According to Protestant theologian Philip Schaff, "The Nicene fathers passed this canon not as introducing anything new, but merely as confirming an existing relation on the basis of church tradition; and that, with special reference to Alexandria, on account of the troubles existing there.
It involves five different arguments "drawn respectively from the grammatical structure of the sentence, from the logical sequence of ideas, from Catholic analogy, from comparison with the process of formation of the Byzantine Patriarchate, and from the authority of the ancients" in favor of an alternative understanding of the canon.
Historically, the influence of these marred confessors has been seen as substantial, but recent scholarship has called this into question.
For the first time, representatives of many of the bishops of the Church convened to agree on a doctrinal statement.
The Arian discussions and debates at the council extended from about May 20, 325, through about June 19.
As early as Pope Sixtus I, some Christians had set Easter to a Sunday in the lunar month of Nisan.
The participating bishops were given free travel to and from their episcopal sees to the council, as well as lodging.
Nevertheless, the controversy continued in various parts of the empire.
Hosius of Cordoba may have presided over its deliberations; he was probably one of the Papal legates.
Others felt that the customary practice of reliance on the Jewish calendar should continue, even if the Jewish computations were in error from a Christian point of view.
As to Meletius himself, episcopal rights and prerogatives were taken from him.
# The view that he was 'mutable or subject to change' was rejected to maintain that the Son just like the Father was beyond any form of weakness or corruptibility, and most importantly that he could not fall away from absolute moral perfection.
Other supporters included Eusebius of Nicomedia, Paulinus of Tyrus, Actius of Lydda, Menophantus of Ephesus, and Theognus of Nicaea.
They justified this break with tradition by arguing that it was in fact the contemporary Jewish calendar that had broken with tradition by ignoring the equinox, and that in former times the 14th of Nisan had never preceded the equinox.
Aware also of "the diversity of opinion" regarding the celebration of Easter and hoping to settle both issues, he sent the "honored" Bishop Hosius of Cordova (Hispania) to form a local church council and "reconcile those who were divided".
Arius himself returned to Constantinople to be readmitted into the Church, but died shortly before he could be received.
Meletius, it was decided, should remain in his own city of Lycopolis in Egypt, but without exercising authority or the power to ordain new clergy; he was forbidden to go into the environs of the town or to enter another diocese for the purpose of ordaining its subjects.
This account is almost certainly apocryphal, as Arius himself would not have been present in the council chamber due to the fact that he was not a bishop.
Other remarkable attendees were Eusebius of Nicomedia; Eusebius of Caesarea, the purported first church historian; circumstances suggest that Nicholas of Myra attended (his life was the seed of the Santa Claus legends); Aristakes of Armenia (son of Saint Gregory the Illuminator); Leontius of Caesarea; Jacob of Nisibis, a former hermit; Hypatius of Gangra; Protogenes of Sardica; Melitius of Sebastopolis; Achilleus of Larissa (considered the Athanasius of Thessaly) and Spyridion of Trimythous, who even while a bishop made his living as a shepherd From foreign places came John, bishop of Persia and India, Theophilus, a Gothic bishop and Stratophilus, bishop of Pitiunt of Georgia.
Despite Constantine's sympathetic interest in the Church, he was not baptized until some 11 or 12 years after the council, putting off baptism as long as he did so as to be absolved from as much sin as possible in accordance with the belief that in baptism all sin is forgiven fully and completely.
Thus, instead of a baptismal creed acceptable to both the Arians and their opponents the council promulgated one which was clearly opposed to Arianism and incompatible with the distinctive core of their beliefs.
Constantine himself was succeeded by two Arian Emperors in the Eastern Empire: his son, Constantius II and Valens.
After being in session for an entire month, the council promulgated on June 19 the original Nicene Creed.
The canon itself was designed only to ensure uniformity of practise at the designated times.
# Jesus Christ is said to be "begotten, not made", asserting that he was not a mere creature, brought into being out of nothing, but the true Son of God, brought into being 'from the substance of the Father'.
These mild measures, however, were in vain; the Meletians joined the Arians and caused more dissension than ever, being among the worst enemies of Athanasius.
The First Council of Nicaea was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great upon the recommendations of a synod led by Hosius of Córdoba in the Eastertide of 325.
According to Hefele, the Council had assigned to Alexandria, "the whole (civil) Diocese of Egypt."
Rome's jurisdiction within Italy had been defined in terms of several of the city's adjacent provinces since Diocletian's reordering of the empire in 293, as the earliest Latin version of the canon indicates, and the rest of the Italian provinces were under the jurisdiction of Milan.
Almost immediately, Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian bishop and cousin to Constantine I, used his influence at court to sway Constantine's favor from the orthodox Nicene bishops to the Arians.
This position is supported by patristic scholar Timothy Barnes in his book ''Constantine and Eusebius''.
When that embassy failed, he turned to summoning a synod at Nicaea, inviting "the most eminent men of the churches in every country".
The controversy between those who argued for independent computations and those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar was formally resolved by the Council, which endorsed the independent procedure that had been in use for some time at Rome and Alexandria.
This belief was expressed by the bishops in the Creed of Nicaea, which would form the basis of what has since been known as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.
The custom of the bishop of Rome was invoked by way of illustration, not because he presided over the whole Church, or over the western Church or even over "his own diocese," but rather because he presided over a few provinces in a diocese that was otherwise administered from Milan.
When Arius and two followers refused to agree, the bishops pronounced clerical judgement by excommunicating them from the Church.
As Eusebius described, Constantine "himself proceeded through the midst of the assembly, like some heavenly messenger of God, clothed in raiment which glittered as it were with rays of light, reflecting the glowing radiance of a purple robe, and adorned with the brilliant splendor of gold and precious stones".
The bishops first pronounced Arius' teachings to be anathema, formulating the creed as a statement of correct doctrine.
One of the projects undertaken by the Council was the creation of a Creed, a declaration and summary of the Christian faith.
Constantine's role regarding Nicaea was that of supreme civil leader and authority in the empire.
Arius, Theonas, and Secundus refused to adhere to the creed, and were thus exiled to Illyria, in addition to being excommunicated.
Eusebius speaks of an almost innumerable host of accompanying priests, deacons and acolytes.
The orthodox bishops won approval of every one of their proposals regarding the Creed.
Arius emphasized the supremacy and uniqueness of God the Father, meaning that the Father alone is almighty and infinite, and that therefore the Father's divinity must be greater than the Son's.
As Emperor, the responsibility for maintaining civil order was his, and he sought that the Church be of one mind and at peace.
They insisted that such a view was in contravention of such Scriptures as "I and the Father are one" and "the Word was God", as such verses were interpreted.
Pagan powers within the Empire sought to maintain and at times re-establish paganism into the seat of the Emperor (see Arbogast and Julian the Apostate).
Of these, the first rank was held by the three patriarchs: Alexander of Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, and Macarius of Jerusalem.
The council of Nicaea dealt primarily with the issue of the deity of Christ.
According to Kauffman, since Milan and Rome were both located within the Diocese of Italy, and Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the Diocese of Oriens, a relevant and "structural congruency" between Rome and Alexandria was readily apparent to the gathered bishops: both had been made to share a diocese of which neither was the chief metropolis.
Thus, the Bishop of Alexandria presided over Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis, while the Bishop of Antioch "enjoyed a similar authority throughout the great diocese of Oriens," and all by the authority of the Bishop of Rome.
The exact meaning of many of the words used in the debates at Nicaea were still unclear to speakers of other languages.
The supporters of Arius included Secundus of Ptolemais, Theonus of Marmarica, Zphyrius, and Dathes, all of whom hailed from the Libyan Pentapolis.
Several creeds were already in existence; many creeds were acceptable to the members of the council, including Arius.
Thus, according to Schaff, the Bishop of Alexandria was to have jurisdiction over the provinces of Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis, just as the Bishop of Rome had authority "with reference to his own diocese."
Another result of the council was an agreement on when to celebrate Easter, the most important feast of the ecclesiastical calendar, decreed in an epistle to the Church of Alexandria in which is simply stated:
In the Council of Nicaea, one specific creed was used to define the Church's faith clearly, to include those who professed it, and to exclude those who did not.
No historical evidence points to involvement on his part in selecting or omitting books for inclusion in commissioned Bibles.
In that scenario, a relevant Roman precedent is invoked, answering Loughlin's argument as to why the custom of a bishop in Rome would have any bearing on a dispute regarding Alexandria in Oriens, and at the same time correcting Schaff's argument that the bishop of Rome was invoked by way of illustration "with reference to his own diocese."
The initial number of bishops supporting Arius was small.
Constantine had invited all 1,800 bishops of the Christian church within the Roman Empire (about 1,000 in the east and 800 in the west), but a smaller and unknown number attended.
No explicit historical record of their dissent actually exists; the signatures of these bishops are simply absent from the Creed.
Athanasius eventually spent most of his life battling against Arianism.
But according to Fr.
The opposing view stemmed from the idea that begetting the Son is itself in the nature of the Father, which is eternal.
And Arius argued that everything else was created through the Son.
The Greek term ''homoousios'', or ''consubstantial'' (i.e., "of the '''same''' substance) is ascribed by Eusebius of Caesarea to Constantine who, on this particular point, may have chosen to exercise his authority.
With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent local and regional councils of Bishops (Synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy—the intent being to define unity of beliefs for the whole of Christendom.
Maris of Chalcedon, who initially supported Arianism, agreed to the whole creed.
Constantine assisted in assembling the council by arranging that travel expenses to and from the bishops' episcopal sees, as well as lodging at Nicaea, be covered out of public funds.
In the Council of Nicaea, "The Church had taken her first great step to define revealed doctrine more precisely in response to a challenge from a heretical theology."
These two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council.
Respecting the clerical decision, and seeing the threat of continued unrest, Constantine also pronounced civil judgement, banishing them into exile.
Those in opposition to Arius believed that to follow the Arian view destroyed the unity of the Godhead, and made the Son unequal to the Father.
This synod had been charged with investigation of the trouble brought about by the Arian controversy in the Greek-speaking east.
Those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar (called "protopaschites" by later historians) were urged to come around to the majority position.
"Resplendent in purple and gold, Constantine made a ceremonial entrance at the opening of the council, probably in early June, but respectfully seated the bishops ahead of himself."
In canon 6, the Council left most of the diocese under Antioch's jurisdiction, and assigned a few provinces of the diocese to Alexandria, "since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also."
The council decided against the Arians overwhelmingly (of the estimated 250–318&nbsp;attendees, all but two agreed to sign the creed and these two, along with Arius, were banished to Illyria).
Likewise, Rome and Milan were both located within the civil Diocese of Italy, Milan being the chief metropolis, yet neither administered the whole.
Alexander maintained that the Son was divine in just the same sense that the Father is, co-eternal with the Father, else he could not be a true Son.
By that time, the accumulation of errors in the Julian solar and lunar calendars had made it the de facto state of affairs that Julian Easter always followed Hebrew Nisan 14.
The Eastern bishops formed the great majority.
Later, Socrates Scholasticus recorded more than 300, and Evagrius, Hilary of Poitiers, Jerome, Dionysius Exiguus, and Rufinus recorded 318.
The '''First Council of Nicea''' (;  ) was a council of Christian bishops convened in the Bithynian city of Nicaea (currently called Iznik, Bursa province, Turkey) by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 325.
"Some 22 of the bishops at the council, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as supporters of Arius.
The bishoprics of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch were placed substantially on equal footing."
# Jesus Christ is described as "Light from Light, true God from true God", proclaiming his divinity.
Rome was named only for illustration; and Antioch and all the other eparchies or provinces were secured their admitted rights.
The contra-Arian argument thus stated that the Logos was "eternally begotten", therefore with no beginning.
The disputed issues centered on the natures and relationship of God (the Father) and the Son of God (Jesus).
The Meletians ultimately died out around the middle of the fifth century.
Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the civil Diocese of Oriens, Antioch being the chief metropolis, but neither administered the whole.
Through it a precedent was set for subsequent general councils to adopt creeds and canons.
In the mean time, paganism remained legal and present in public affairs.
The emperor was present as an overseer and presider, but did not cast any official vote.
Bishop Hosius of Cordova, one of the firm Homoousians, may well have helped bring the council to consensus.
The Latin-speaking provinces sent at least five representatives: Marcus of Calabria from Italia, Cecilian of Carthage from Africa, Hosius of Córdoba from Hispania, Nicasius of Die from Gaul, and Domnus of Stridon from the province of the Danube.
By the later 3rd century some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with what they took to be the disorderly state of the Jewish calendar.
The Council declared that the Son was true God, co-eternal with the Father and begotten from His same substance, arguing that such a doctrine best codified the Scriptural presentation of the Son as well as traditional Christian belief about him handed down from the Apostles.
These bishops did not travel alone; each one had permission to bring with him two priests and three deacons, so the total number of attendees could have been above 1,800.
St. Alexander of Alexandria and Athanasius took the first position; the popular presbyter Arius, from whom the term Arianism comes, took the second.
# He is said to be "of one being with The Father", proclaiming that although Jesus Christ is "true God" and God The Father is also "true God", the are "of one being", in accord to what is found in John 10:30: "I and the Father are one".
From earliest times, various creeds served as a means of identification for Christians, as a means of inclusion and recognition, especially at baptism.
That provincial arrangement of Roman and Milanese jurisdiction within Italy therefore was a relevant precedent, and provided an administrative solution to the problem facing the council—namely, how to define Alexandrian and Antiochian jurisdiction within the Diocese of Oriens.
The long-term effects of the Council of Nicaea were significant.
Valens could not resolve the outstanding ecclesiastical issues, and unsuccessfully confronted St.
Much of the debate hinged on the difference between being "born" or "created" and being "begotten".
This council is generally considered the beginning of the period of the First seven Ecumenical Councils in the History of Christianity.
So the doctrine in a more full-fledged form was not formulated until the Council of Constantinople in 360 AD, and a final form formulated in 381 AD, primarily crafted by Gregory of Nyssa.
The majority of the bishops agreed.
Christianity was illegal in the empire until the emperors Constantine and Licinius agreed in 313 to what became known as the Edict of Milan.
Also for the first time, the Emperor played a role, by calling together the bishops under his authority, and using the power of the state to give the council's orders effect.
