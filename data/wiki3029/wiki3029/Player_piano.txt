* '''Hand-played rolls''' introduced musical phrasing into the rolls, so that player pianists did not have to introduce it through the use of tempo controls something that few owners ever felt much inclination to do.
Typically an electric motor provides power to remove the human operator from the necessity to provide motive power by treadling.
From having the performance in "streaming" form on a tape to extracting the note events into a list in a computer is a fairly small step.
So great was the revival that in the 1960s, production of player pianos started again.
He started with a pneumatic roll reader (from the mid-1970s, for the IMI Cassette Converter system and later projects) and later moved to an optical system.
The conversion process usually involves cutting open the bottom of the piano to install mechanical parts under the keyboard, although one organization&nbsp;— Logos Foundation&nbsp;— has manufactured a portable, external kit.
Live Performance Model LX, was sold to Steinway in 2014 and re-branded as Spirio.
From the early days, manufacturers sought to create mechanisms which would pick out the melody of a musical composition over the background of the rest of the music in the same manner as a live pianist.
Various manufacturers made numerous ranges of instruments featuring different combinations of pianos, organ pipework, percussion and other fittings.
Richard Stibbons started his roll-scanning attempts in the mid-1990s, and described his progress in PPG article “The PC Pianola” in December 1995.
As of 1876, in Philadelphia, three working devices were exhibited that between them contained almost all the components that the final player piano would require.
The Aeolian Duo-Art recording machinery was destroyed by bombing during World War II, as was the Welte factory in Freiburg.
However, even analogue uses of the scan, such as operating instruments directly, benefits from the recreated master because of the way it removes timing errors from the basic scan, and in so doing allows the accuracy of the scanner itself to be calibrated.
Other, cheaper makes were launched.
Numerous companies made these utilizing different technology.
The rationale is that starting with the master in this form, anything can be done with the music&nbsp;– cut new rolls, operate player pianos fitted with electronic valves, or simulate a performance for playing on modern instruments&nbsp;– all without introducing any errors.
In contrast to other piano brands, a recording option is not available in Steinway Spirio pianos.
Most reproducing pianos are capable of manual over-ride operation, and many are constructed for dual functionality both as regular player pianos and also as reproducing pianos.
This was a major catastrophe for many small manufacturers, who had spent all their capital on setting up 65-note player operations, and the result was rapid consolidation in the industry.
This device, powered by suction and bellows, moved realistically in response to a pilot's operation of the controls.
A few companies struggled on through the 1930s.
In England, Aeolian had a huge factory and sales network, so easily outsold the Ampico.
When the Wall Street crash came in October 1929, the player piano was already in a very weak position, and sales effectively ceased.
Rex Lawson had raised the topic as part of his work developing a perforation-level roll editor software suite for his Perforetur rolls, and the topic was publicly discussed in the PPG bulletin during winter 1994/5 when Rex explained precisely why rolls should be copied punch-for-punch, digitally.
Steinway now manufactures a player piano based on Wayne Stahnke's Live Performance LX system.
MIDI files containing converted antique piano-rolls can be purchased on the Internet.
; Theme control: These instruments have peripheral pneumatic hardware systems fitted which, when used in conjunction with special music rolls, are able to highlight those notes in the score which are intended to be accented away from those whose volume it is desired to subdue.
A new player piano conversion kit was introduced in 2007-08 by Wayne Stahnke, the inventor of the Bösendorfer SE reproducing system, called the "LX".
Early barrel pianos moved the hammer back and forwards continuously as the operator turned the handle, but the hammers did not strike the strings until moved slightly forwards by a pin in the barrel.
More subtle systems (such as Hupfeld's "Solodant" and Aeolian's "Themodist") have a graduated theme control where the background subdued level and the foreground melody level are both controllable.
This device entered manufacture, and is generally regarded as the first practical player device.
The aim of this group has been to focus and publicise scanning efforts worldwide, encouraging sharing of progress and knowledge, a radical shift from the earlier essentially private attempts.
Little new technically arose through the 1920s.
# the music stencil is created metronomically via a piano-keyboard operated punch machine
Any player made anywhere in the world could now play any make of roll.
As a result, post-World War I American and British roll collections look very different.
Amongst them was Frank Holland, who formed his collection while working in Canada.
Aeolian introduced Metrostyle in 1901 and the Themodist in 1904, the latter being an invention "bringing out the melody clearly above the accompaniment."
Huge sums were spent: by 1903, the Aeolian Company had more than 9,000 roll titles in their catalog, adding 200 titles per month.
This played the note, but at a fixed dynamic and with a tremolo action quite unlike a pianist.
When using the analogue version, all its timing errors are carried through to whatever you do with it.
An early musical instrument to be automated was the organ, which is comparatively easy to operate automatically.
A player piano is an acoustic piano where the sound is produced by hammer strikes on the piano strings.
, several player piano conversion kits are available (PianoDisc, Pianomation, etc.
With some modification, and pneumatic reading of the roll, this would become the final player piano some 20 years later, although the Schmoele brothers never benefited from it.
The true player piano was designed to be a fully interactive musical experience rather than merely an automatic instrument, and hence they are fitted with interactive control levers intended for the "player pianist" or "pianolist" to create a music performance to their own taste.
The ability to store the extracted data on electronic media marked the start of the modern era of scanning, but did little more than act as a substitute for the paper roll.
; Split stack control: These instruments (the vast majority of all player pianos) have the pneumatic player mechanism divided into two approximately equal halves.
At one point, more than half of all pianos being made in America contained a player unit.
Ragtime music did feature, but not commonly: in this period, the player was being sold on its artistic capabilities to rich buyers.
This is the case because virtually all rolls were punched in fixed rows, where punches will occur only in one row or the next, but never in between: the roll is effectively a digital storage medium.
However, the air flow is not sufficient to drive a piano mechanism.
This uses the same technology as domestic flatbed scanners, hence the term roll scanner.
In recent years, there has been greater focus on full rebuilding as original instruments finally stop working.
This obviates the need for human manipulation of the manual dynamic control levers.
Electrical or electronic components are limited to moving the keys or hammers mimicking the actions of a person; no sound is produced from electrically amplified audio.
The MIDI files can trigger electromagnetic devices called solenoids, which use electric current to drive small mechanical pistons mounted to the key action inside the piano.
Barrels do not provide a percussive force, but a relatively gentle switching motion.
The volume dynamics are created by peripheral pneumatic expression accessories under control from system-specific music roll coding.
The consensus was key to avoiding a costly format war, which plagued almost every other form of entertainment media that followed roll music.
This device, the Welte-Mignon, was launched in 1904.
The player piano was not an obscure by-line it was the dominant force in the industry.
The start of the player period can probably be seen as the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia, USA.
Different player systems have different perforation sizes, channel layouts and spool fittings though the majority conform to one or two predominant formats latterly adopted as the industry standard.
This device applied the entire playing strength to the paper, so would have shredded it rapidly, and the device would have had to be as wide as the piano keyboard.
Roll scanning is the process of reading a music roll into a computerized form that can be used for any purpose, such as cutting new rolls or operating old or new instruments directly.
Richard Simonton purchased the surviving Welte-Mignon rolls from Edwin Welte, and the first disc recordings were made of the performances.
; Reproducing pianos: These are fully automated versions of the player piano requiring no human manual control in order to produce the illusion of a live musical performance.
Manufacturers of these systems were the UK "Dalian" and "Kastonome" and the US "Solo Carola".
This kept the 11¼-inch roll, but now had smaller holes spaced at 9 to the inch.
The earliest practical piano playing device was probably the Forneaux Pianista, which used compressed air to inflate a bellows when the barrel pin opened a valve.
They described a 'double valve' system that acted as a pneumatic amplifier, reading the roll electrically and operating the pneumatic with an electromagnet.
; Isolated theme: The hardware of these pianos is able to pick out the melody notes away from their background  accompaniment within the entire range of the keyboard without the necessity for breaking up chords i.e.
It used a traditional barrel, but tripped a pneumatic device that inflated bellows rapidly to operate the note.
QRS's presence ensured that owners of newly awakened players could purchase rolls of the latest titles, so ensuring that the instrument remained current, not just a historical curiosity.
The Link Company commercialized the device in 1929.
The distinction between these instruments lies in the way sounds are produced.
The acceleration of developments leading to the pneumatic 'player' device started in the 1840s and began to reach some recognizable device in the 1870s.
In 1871 a perforated cardboard book was substituted for the barrel, but it was still read using sprung fingers.
In 1851, Pape, England, submitted a patent that recognized the need to remove the playing force from the paper, using light springs to read the roll and activate a more robust device which plays the note&nbsp;— a mechanical amplifier.
A major survivor throughout this was the QRS piano roll company, originally an offshoot of Melville Clarke's operation.
By the early 1960s, Frank Holland had formed the British Piano Museum (now the Musical Museum) in Brentford.
Roll masters are not literally replicated, because they were originally large cardboard rolls, but re-created in a computerized form.
When World War I came in 1914 and German patents were seized in the US, these two companies were left to compete with each other.
Most modern player pianos come with an electronic device that can record and playback MIDI files on floppy disks and/or CD-ROMs, and a MIDI interface that enables computers to drive the piano directly for more advanced operations.
Hunt & Bradish of the USA, 1849, used a roll read by sprung fingers, the springs being strong enough to operate the piano mechanism directly.
With sales growing rapidly, and the instruments themselves relatively mature, this decade saw a wider variety of rolls become available.
During the early 1950s, a number of collectors began to rescue player pianos and all the other instruments of the 1920s and earlier.
The player piano would provide aspiring pianists and music lovers with the technical dexterity they lacked while permitting them to control the musical performance interactively as if they were an accomplished pianist.
Word rolls never became the norm in England, always being charged at a 20% premium over non-word rolls.
This allows exact replica rolls to be made, and maximizes the accuracy of any secondary activity.
Almost all modern player pianos use MIDI to interface with computer equipment.
The player piano sold globally in its heyday, and music rolls were manufactured extensively in the USA, as well as most European countries, South America, Australia and New Zealand.
The lingering roll production in England finally ceased in 1941 when paper rationing made it impossible to continue.
While the player piano matured in America, a young inventor in Germany, Edwin Welte, was working on a player which controlled all the aspects of the performance automatically, so that his machine would play back a recorded performance exactly as if the original pianist was sitting at the piano keyboard.
Basic theme pianos subdue all notes and release full power to only those notes which are aligned with special music roll "theme" perforations.
By the end of the decade, the piano player device was obsolete, as was the 65-note format.
Simple reed and pipe organs using this sort of system are still being produced.
A British equivalent was the Silloth trainer, based on Duo-Art technology.
Other manufacturers followed, and production has continued intermittently ever since.
McTammany had been experimenting since the mid-1860s, and went on to be one of the key names in the early player industry.
The power for the notes is provided by air from a bellows system, and the organist or player device only has to operate a valve to control the available air.
Radio and these new records rapidly eroded the market for the player piano, and it was declining from the mid-1920s onwards.
A new full-scale roll format, playing all 88 notes, was agreed at an industry conference in Buffalo in 1908, the so-called Buffalo Convention.
Soon afterwards he adopted the master replication idea, described very thoroughly in September 2000.
In America by the end of the decade, the new 'jazz age' and the rise of the fox-trot confirmed the player piano as the instrument of popular music, with classical music increasingly relegated to the reproducing piano.
It was probably based on the work of John McTammany.
Roll master re-creation is the process of understanding how the roll was originally manufactured so that errors arising from the scanning are removed, and the computer works to the same accuracy as the original perforators in the roll factory.
the note lengths of a live performance have been captured.
The first serious and sustained roll master replication exercise was probably that of Wayne Stahnke, who described his by-then completed methods in the Mechanical Music Digest in March 1996, and used them to practical advantage in his Rachmaninoff-Bösendorfer CDs.
Such computerisation of the scanned data adds the ability to edit and manipulate it.
In 1847, Alexander Bain described a device that used a paper roll as a 'travelling valve' that allowed air to flow through the reeds of a reed organ.
; Orchestrions: These are automated instruments typically intended from use in a coin-operated commercial setting rather than any domestic one.
Things were somewhat different in England, where the Aeolian Company continued to promote classical material to a receptive public.
Roll scanning itself is not of major significance&nbsp;– it simply adds optical technology to the pneumatic, electrical and mechanical technologies previously used to extract data from perforated paper.
It created new marketing opportunities, as manufacturers could now get the foremost pianists and composers of the day to record their performances on a piano roll, allowing owners of player pianos to experience such a performance in their own homes on their own instruments, exactly as the original pianist had played it.
The key advance we are concerned about here is the manipulation that converts the analogue scan data to a replica of the perforation master.
Live performance or computer generated music can be recorded in MIDI file format for accurate reproduction later on such instruments.
The joint Aeolian-American operation stopped making new classical rolls and concentrated on popular material, and the final new rolls were issued in the late 1930s.
# the music is marked out on master stencil on a purely metronomic basis direct from the printed sheet music with the player-pianists being left to create their own music performance
The nature of the mechanism is such that where a chord occurs notes to be emphasised have to be advanced slightly away from their neighbors in order for the mechanism to identify them.
The hammers hit repeatedly until the pin was removed.
It cost $250 (£65) (equivalent to over $6,000 (£4,000) in 2009 money).
Only a few well-capitalized companies continued in business after this.
The ubiquity of computers makes scanning fundamental to the preservation of rolls of all types, as well as providing the basis for secondary activities such as operating instruments directly.
The technical advances of the 1920s were instead largely in radio technology.
The peak sales of instruments and rolls were in the first few years of the decade.
A leap in thought occurred in the 1873 patent of the Schmoele brothers.
In 1931 Aeolian purchased the American Piano Company, makers of the Ampico.
During this period player piano pneumatic technology was used as the basis for the aircraft training simulators by inventor Edwin Albert Link.
Novel attempts to combine the appeal of the player piano and its new rivals were made by building radios and/or phonographs into player pianos themselves, but even this could not entice the public to continue buying player pianos.
The piano is a complex instrument, requiring each note to be struck with a different force to control the dynamics of the performance.
It proved to be difficult for a player device to combine a variable percussive force and a controlled note duration.
Harvey Roehl's Vestal Press was a major driving force in raising awareness of the player piano within the general population.
A player piano is neither an electric piano, electronic piano, nor a digital piano.
This operated a reed organ.
The Pianola was advertised in one of the most high-profile campaigns ever, making unprecedented use of full-page color advertisements.
They also exhibited at Philadelphia.
It was reported that the last remaining mass producer of piano rolls in the world, QRS Music, temporarily halted production of the rolls on December 31, 2008.
Aeolian revived the Pianola, albeit this time in a small spinet piano suited to post-war housing.
This bellows struck the piano key and so played the note.
The most familiar such system is the Marantz Pianocorder, but at least two systems were produced, by Wayne Stahnke and Peter Phillips, to operate pneumatic pianos.
The enthusiast era had, tentatively, begun.
The development of the player piano was the gradual overcoming of the various difficulties of controlled percussive striking and note duration.
However, it was to be 20 years before all these aspects were combined.
The first device to address the practical requirement of operating a piano mechanism was Forneaux's, of 1863.
On returning to England he located a number of like-minded enthusiasts and started to hold meetings at his house in west London.
If instead the rows are counted, the result is an exact representation of the original roll&nbsp;– a perfect digital copy.
This can be done by applying knowledge about the original roll's creation to the scan.
The operator can lower the volume of either half of the keyboard independently of the other in order to create musical effects.
Early enthusiasts could often get by with limited patching, but the repair requirements have slowly risen, although even to this day it is possible to find original 1920s' instruments that still work after a fashion a tribute to their quality, and an indication of their continued popularity.
# a live performance is played onto a special piano connected to an electronically operated marking mechanism, and a physical stencil is produced from this live output, either as-is or after some general regularisation of tempo where necessary
A standard 65-note format evolved, with  rolls and holes spaced 6 to the inch, although several player manufacturers used their own form of roll incompatible with other makes.
In the early 1920s, many pianists of note, in classical and popular fields, were called on to make rolls.
He has been offering commercial scanning and roll master re-creation since the mid-1990s.
Sales peaked in 1924, then declined as the improvement in phonograph recordings due to electrical recording methods developed in the mid-1920s.
They were eventually superseded by the juke box following the introduction of effective electrical sound amplification.
This is achieved by the utilization of music rolls where tempo mapping is fully incorporated into the music rolls i.e.
To bring capital to the business, they sold off all their overseas assets, so the large piano factory at Hayes was closed and sold with one month's notice, to the Gramophone Company, also based in the town.
Music rolls for pneumatic player pianos, often known as piano rolls, consist of a continuous sheet of paper rolled on to a spool.
In 1959 this was formalized as 'The Player Piano Group'.
The spool fits into the player piano spool box whereupon the free end of the music sheet is hooked onto the take-up spool which will unwind the roll at an even pace across the reading mechanism (the "tracker bar") The music score to be played is programmed onto the paper by means of perforations.
However, the immediate aftermath of the war saw the growth of interest in this lost era.
In 1961, Max Kortlander died of an unexpected heart attack, and QRS was run by his wife until she sold the company to Ramsi Tick in 1966, in whom it found another stalwart champion whose business philosophy was not so much profit as to limit losses.
It is intended that the operator manually manipulates the control levers in order to produce a musical performance.
However, QRS Music still list themselves as the only roll manufacturer remaining, and claim to have 45,000 titles available with "new titles being added on a regular basis".
Many of these companies were the result of consolidation throughout the 1920s, which had already seen the loss of most names, particularly in the roll-making field.
It is estimated that perhaps 5% of players sold were reproducing pianos.
Perhaps the most significant was the launch of a significantly improved form of the Ampico system, the Ampico B, in 1926.
Music is programmed via a number of methods.
This is particularly true when making recut rolls, where imposing the punch-row spacing of the perforator over the (different) row spacing of the original roll causes surprisingly obvious and audible errors.
At this exhibition were a number of automatic player devices, including the Pianista, that contained the elements which would lead to the player.
Owned by the mid-1920s by Max Kortlander, and funded by his income as a composer, QRS continued to issue rolls, all of them created by J. Lawrence Cook, chief roll arranger from 1921 to 1961 (he supplemented his income as a postal worker).
The pioneer of this decade was Melville Clark, who introduced two key ideas: the full-scale roll which could play every note on the piano keyboard, and the internal player as standard.
This led directly to the launch of the Rollscanners group in February 2001.
The key development there was the introduction of amplification, so that it was possible to sit around the radio and listen as a family, unlike the earlier crystal sets which required the use of headphones.
While there are many minor differences between manufacturers, a player piano is a piano that contains a manually controlled pneumatically operating piano player mechanism.
Many companies' catalogs ran to thousands of rolls, mainly of light, religious or classical music.
Within UK Player Piano Group circles, the topic of recreating roll masters was already well established by 1996.
The first successful instrument was called the "Mignon" launched by Welte in 1904.
A large number of titles from all manufacturers survive to this day, and rolls still turn up regularly in large quantities.
Van Dusen's American patent of 1867 was the first to describe a pneumatic striker operated by a roll.
Most American roll companies stopped offering large classical catalogs before 1920, and abandoned 'instrumental' rolls (those without words) within a few years.
a software workaround.
This sold by the tens of thousands, and was followed by books on how to rebuild and restore these instruments.
Scanning simply counts the distance from the start of the roll to each note event, giving an analogue, and hence inaccurate, representation of the roll.
Surprisingly, the missing component was the pneumatic reading of the roll.
* '''Word rolls''', a significant 1916 innovation, featured printed lyrics in the margins, making it simple to use players to accompany singing in the home, a very popular activity in the years before radio and acceptable disc recordings became available.
In 1876, John McTammany exhibited a working player in Philadelphia that used a paper roll read using sprung fingers whose slight movement triggered a mechanical player device.
This was in all probability due to the lack of suitably flexible airtight material to translate the air flow into the mechanical movement needed to trigger the player device.
It was exhibited in Philadelphia in 1876.
This recognized that a hard strike was needed to throw the hammer towards the keys.
Various aids to the human operator were developed:
QRS today offer a traditional player piano in their Story and Clark piano.
Electronic descendants of these devices are now widespread.
Two major advances were the introduction of the '''hand-played roll''', both classical and popular, and the '''word roll'''.
The entire force required to sound the note must be given by the performer hitting the keys.
Replication of the original master from which a perforated paper roll was created is the highest aim of roll scanning.
The advent of electrical amplification in home music reproduction via radio in the same period helped cause their eventual decline in popularity, and the stock market crash of 1929 virtually wiped out production.
The other major advance was the arrival of major commercial rivals for the Welte-Mignon: the Ampico and the Duo-Art systems, both launched around 1914.
