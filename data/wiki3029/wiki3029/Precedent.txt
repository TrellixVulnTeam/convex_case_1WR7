Under the literal rule, the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means.
However, lower courts occasionally cite dissents, either for either a limiting principle on the majority, or for propositions that are not stated in the majority opinion and not inconsistent with that majority, or to explain a disagreement with the majority and to urge reform (while following the majority in the outcome).
Courts in one jurisdiction are influenced by decisions in others, and notably better rules may be adopted over time.
Exceptions are extremely limited, for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts (for example, one claim might be exclusively federal, and the other exclusively state).
He revisited this concept during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept.
This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.
The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases.
In the United States, ''stare decisis'' can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and state court systems.
Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained.
Some mixed systems, such as Scots law in Scotland, South-African law, and the law of Quebec and Louisiana, do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both.
In the strongest sense, "directly in point" means that: (1) the question resolved in the precedent case is the same as the question to be resolved in the pending case, (2) resolution of that question was necessary to the disposition of the precedent case; (3) the significant facts of the precedent case are also presented in the pending case, and (4) no additional facts appear in the pending case that might be treated as significant.
Claim preclusion applies whether the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case, even if the later case raises a different legal theory, even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case.
Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision.
Another example might be ''Fisher v Bell'', where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of "offer for sale" in contract law.
This situation changed, however, after the issuance of the Practice Statement of 1966.
By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the Constitution.
Common patterns for dissenting opinions include:
Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (the mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of the Third Circuit Court, but not by rulings in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography.
As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.
In the latter meaning, the case in question cannot be decided through referring to and/or relying on precedent.
Scholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.
The doctrine of binding precedent or ''stare decisis'' is basic to the English legal system.
Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over day-to-day proceedings in lower courts, in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (''sua sponte'') at any time to reverse or overrule judgments of the lower courts.
The act said it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces in the vicinity of a prohibited place.
Unlike most civil law systems, common law systems follow the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts.
The first is the rule that a decision made by a superior court, or by the same court in an earlier decision, is binding precedent that the court itself and all its inferior courts are obligated to follow.
Supporters of the system, such as minimalists, argue that obeying precedent makes decisions "predictable."
The inferior courts are bound to obey precedent established by the appellate court for their jurisdiction, and all supreme court precedent.
For example, in England, the High Court and the Court of Appeal are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.
The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal.
Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.
Originalism is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge).
Judges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to reach a decision in a case.
state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent.
In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in ''Roe v. Wade''), that side can protect its position from being reversed "by a kind of super-stare decisis."
The golden rule is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result.
The second principle, regarding persuasive precedent, is an advisory one that courts can and do ignore occasionally.
In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency.
The Circuit Courts of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, so long as there is no binding Supreme Court precedent.
Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and it may be necessary to distinguish how the law is applied in one district, province, division or appellate department.
The inferior courts conduct almost all trial proceedings.
Litigation that is settled out of court generates no written decision, and thus has no precedential effect.
On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.
Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see Law of the case re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).
One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants certiorari (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of a federal law.
In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is ''prima facie'' or presumptively binding between courts.
On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent.
''Stare decisis'' is not mandated by the Constitution, and if it causes unconstitutional results then the historical evidence of original understanding can be re-examined.
Thus, a word may have different definitions in different areas of the law, or different rules may apply so that a question has different answers in different legal contexts.
In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court.
As noted above, "''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law"; Justice Antonin Scalia argues in ''A Matter of Interpretation'' that America is a civil law nation, not a common law nation.
The British House of Lords, as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before the creation of the UK Supreme Court, was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case ''London Street Tramways v London County Council 1898 AC 375''.
Once a case is finally decided, any issues decided in the previous case may be binding against the party that lost the issue in later cases, even in cases involving other parties.
:That is the way of the common law, the judges preferring to go 'from case to case, like the ancient Mediterranean mariners, hugging the coast from point to point, and avoiding the dangers of the open sea of system or science.
The application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' from a superior court to an inferior court is sometimes called ''vertical stare decisis''.
On an interpretation of state law, whether common law or statutory law, the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well.
Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in civil law jurisdictions.
The controversial idea that some decisions are virtually immune from being overturned, regardless of whether they were decided correctly in the first place, is the idea to which the term "super ''stare decisis''" now usually refers.
In Civil law and pluralist systems precedent is not binding but case law is taken into account by the courts.
''Stare decisis'' means to stand by things decided.
Appellate courts, be they judicial (''hovrätter'') or administrative (''kammarrätter''), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.
Within the federal legal systems of several common-law countries, and most especially the United States, it is relatively common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g.
Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles.
For example, when the Supreme Court says that the First Amendment applies in a specific way to suits for slander, then every court is bound by that precedent in its interpretation of the First Amendment as it applies to suits for slander.
The word means, literally and legally, the decision.
Once a case is decided, the same plaintiff cannot sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts.
Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue Guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the Highway Code.
For example, if a first case decides that a party was negligent, then other plaintiffs may rely on that earlier determination in later cases, and need not re-prove the issue of negligence.
However, the Practice Statement has been seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort.
In Sweden, for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems.
Courts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', because foreign decisions are not binding.
These features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of ''stare decisis'':
This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct.
"Unpublished" federal appellate decisions are published in the Federal Appendix.
Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts.
A court may consider the ruling of a higher court that is not binding.
Their fellow judges' decisions may be persuasive but are not binding.
As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.
''Stare decisis'' is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the legal positivist principle that only the legislature may make law.
The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case, not split the case.
For example, in ''Adler v George'' (1964), the defendant was found guilty under the Official Secrets Act of 1920.
Professor  Caleb Nelson, a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of ''stare decisis'' in originalist jurisprudence:
The second is the principle that a court should not overturn its own precedent unless there is a strong reason to do so and should be guided by principles from lateral and inferior courts.
For example, in a case of an auto accident, the plaintiff cannot sue first for property damage, and then personal injury in a separate case.
Binding precedent relies on the legal principle of ''stare decisis''.
An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish the decisions based on significant differences in the facts applicable to each case.
In law, a binding precedent (also known as a mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all lower courts under common law legal systems.
Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called ''persuasive authority'' — indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.
They may be bound by a decision reached in a previous case.
Insofar as precedent is concerned, ''stare decisis'' is important only for the decision, for the detailed legal consequence following a detailed set of facts.
Two facts are crucial to determining whether a precedent is binding:
Essential to the development of case-law is the publication of notable judgments in the form of law reports for use by lawyers, courts and the general public, including those judgments which, when delivered or later, are accepted as being "leading cases" or "landmark decisions".
In civil law and pluralist systems, as under Scots law, precedent is not binding but case law is taken into account by the courts.
As a result, Lord Bridge stated he was "undeterred by the consideration that the decision in ''Anderton v Ryan'' was so recent.
The phrase ''obiter dicta'' is usually translated as "other things said", but due to the high number of judges and individual concurring opinions, it is often hard to distinguish from the ''ratio decidendi'' (reason for the decision).
"The rule of ''stare decisis'', though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible.
At the top of the federal or national system is the Supreme Court, and underneath are lower federal courts.
Consider the word "decisis".
This critique is recent, as in the early history of the United States, citation of English authority was ubiquitous.
Under the broad method, the court may reinterpret the law at will when it is clear that there is only one way to read the statute.
A judge in a subsequent case, particularly in a different jurisdiction, could find the dissenting judge's reasoning persuasive.
There are disadvantages and advantages of binding precedent, as noted by scholars and jurists.
Courts may consider ''obiter dicta'' in opinions of higher courts.
An Intermediate state appellate court is generally bound to follow the decisions of the highest court of that state.
Law professors in common law traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions.
It enabled the House of Lords to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions.
In federal or multi-jurisdictional law systems there may exist conflicts between the various lower appellate courts.
This doctrine is similar to ''stare decisis'' insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result.
Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as ''binding precedent'' (alternately ''metaphorically precedent'', ''mandatory'' or ''binding authority'', etc.).
For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.
Any court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, in order to reach a different conclusion.
Lord Denning, first of the High Court of Justice, later of the Court of Appeal, provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of estoppel starting in the ''High Trees'' case: ''Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd'' 1947 K.B.
Regarding constitutional interpretations, there is concern that over-reliance on the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' can be subversive.
Precedent of a United States court of appeals may be overruled only by the court ''en banc,'' that is, a session of all the active appellate judges of the circuit, or by the United States Supreme Court, not simply by a different three-judge panel.
Such a case can set forth a completely original issue of law for decision by the courts.
The courts of England and Wales are free to consider decisions of other jurisdictions, and give them whatever persuasive weight the English court sees fit, even though these other decisions are not binding precedent.
A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of comparative negligence (replacing contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 Tennessee Supreme Court decision ''McIntyre v. Balentine'' (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted comparative negligence schemes).
In the jurisdiction of the original decision, however, a judge should only overturn the holding of a court lower or equivalent in the hierarchy.
The state court systems have hierarchy structures similar to that of the federal system.
A matter of first impression (known as ''primae impressionis'' in Latin) is a legal case in which there is no binding authority on the matter presented.
This occurred in ''Re Sigsworth'' (1935) where a man who murdered his mother was forbidden from inheriting her estate, despite a statute to the contrary.
'''Case law''', in common law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent.
Within a single case, once there's been a first appeal, both the lower court and the appellate court itself will not further review the same issue, and will not re-review an issue that could have been appealed in the first appeal.
If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better."
In ''R v G & R'' 2003, the House of Lords overruled its decision in ''Caldwell'' 1981, which had allowed the Lords to establish mens rea ("guilty mind") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a "reasonable person," regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.
A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if the lower court feels that the precedent is unjust; the lower court may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question.
A litigant may also consider ''obiter dicta'' if a court has previously signaled that a particular legal argument is weak and may even warrant sanctions if repeated.
Or, a court may view the matter before it as one of "first impression," not governed by any controlling precedent.
In that situation, courts will look to holdings of other jurisdictions for persuasive authority.
In the common law tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedent which record how and why prior cases have been decided.
As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French Cassation Court and the Council of State, is recognized as being ''de facto'' binding on lower courts.
Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.
In a legal context, this is understood to mean that courts should generally abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters.
Courts may consider the writings of eminent legal scholars in treatises, restatements of the law, and law reviews.
The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.
The Supreme Court of California's explanation of this principle is that
The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as '''''stare decisis'''''.
The United States Supreme Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is "explicitly" labeled by the court as an "independent" ground for the decision is not treated as "simply a dictum."
Possibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit "the additional step" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, "Clarence Thomas doesn't believe in stare decisis, period.
Lower courts are bound by the precedent set by higher courts within their region.
The court chose not to accept the wording literally.
The term "super-precedent" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision.
In common law jurisdictions, where law students study case law to understand the application of law to facts, as well as to learn judicial interpretations of statutes, unreported rulings in trials and hearings are not treated as "case law" or "precedents" which serve as authority for deciding later cases.
Courts try to formulate the common law as a "seamless web" so that principles in one area of the law apply to other areas.
If a lower court judge disagrees with a higher court precedent on what the First Amendment should mean, the lower court judge must rule according to the binding precedent.
All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a "supreme court").
For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously.
This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution.
This is the result of the legal positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary.
In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and "what works," contemporary standards of justice, and ''stare decisis''.
Several rules may cause a decision to apply as narrow "precedent" to preclude future legal positions of the specific parties to a case, even if a decision is non-precedential with respect to all other parties.
However, some courts (such as German courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than common law courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.
Where there are several members of a court, there may be one or more judgments given; only the ratio decidendi of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in argument.
The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome.
* an explanation of how the outcome of the case might be different on slightly different facts, in an attempt to limit the holding of the majority
Courts may consider rulings made in other courts that are of equivalent authority in the legal system.
In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent.
Special features of the English legal system include the following:
For example, in ''Corkery v Carpenter'' (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle.
Firstly, the hierarchy of the courts needs to be accepted, and an efficient system of law reporting.
Moreover, in American law, the ''Erie'' doctrine requires federal courts sitting in diversity actions to apply state substantive law, but in a manner consistent with how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case.
Widely cited non-binding sources include legal encyclopedias such as ''Corpus Juris Secundum'' and ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', or the published work of the Law Commission or the American Law Institute.
Exceptions are limited to three "exceptional circumstances:" (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when the law changes after the first appeal, for example by a decision of a higher court, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.
:The reasons why this Court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution.
Under the doctrine of ''stare decisis'', a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears.
# The position in the court hierarchy of the court which decided the precedent, relative to the position in the court trying the current case.
A case decided by a multi-judge panel could result in a split decision.
Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the common law tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition.
Judges try to minimize these conflicts, but they arise from time to time, and under principles of 'stare decisis', may persist for some time.
When two of those people are judges, the tension among two lines of precedent may be resolved as follows.
While they don't necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension.
Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to a word used in a legislative provision or it is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be used.
The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions apply a form of extreme legal positivism which holds that legislation is the only valid source of law because it has been voted on democratically; thus, it is not the judiciary's role to create law, but rather to interpret and apply statute, and therefore their decisions must reflect that.
In the United States federal court system, the intermediate appellate courts are divided into thirteen "circuits," each covering some range of territory ranging in size from the District of Columbia alone up to seven states.
Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both ''stare decisis'' and ''jurisprudence constante''.
These are called ''ratio decidendi'' and constitute a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called ''obiter dicta'', which have persuasive authority but are not technically binding.
Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as ''Recueil Dalloz'' in France.
Each panel of judges on the court of appeals for a circuit is bound to obey the prior appellate decisions of the same circuit.
Precedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law.
On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court.
In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision.
# Whether the facts of the current case come within the scope of the principle of law in previous decisions.
One of the first acts of many of the new state legislatures was to adopt the body of English common law into the law of the state.
In practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize forum shopping.
Black's Law Dictionary defines "precedent" as a "rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases."
The Supreme Court splits on this issue.
Usually only an appeal accepted by the court of last resort will resolve such differences and, for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.
In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law.
For these reasons, the obiter dicta may often be taken into consideration by a court.
Until the higher court changes the ruling (or the law itself is changed), the binding precedent is authoritative on the meaning of the law.
The two highest courts, the Supreme Court (''Högsta domstolen'') and the Supreme Administrative Court (''Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen''), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law.
This is the most strict form of the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' (one not applied, previously, in common law jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).
The court must find genuine difficulties before it declines to use the literal rule.
Occasionally, a lower court judge explicitly states personal disagreement with the judgment he or she has rendered, but that he or she is required to do so by binding precedent.
This principle is called "law of the case."
But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.
Persuasive weight might be given to other common law courts, such as from the United States, most often where the American courts have been particularly innovative, e.g.
The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the Latin maxim '''''Stare decisis et non quieta movere''''': "to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed."
In the United States, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the concept of a U.S. court considering foreign law or precedent has been considered controversial by some parties.
A precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original "Per Incuriam".
