''The Se7ens'' is the UK's longest running one make motor racing championship, having been introduced in 1966.
The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the hydrolastic system was first used on the Morris 1100, launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964.
Although the 4WD Moke could climb a 1:2 gradient, it lacked enough ground clearance for military use.
Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.
The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the Mini Hatch.
The Pickup was basic, although the factory brochure described a "fully equipped Mini Pick-up is also available which includes a recirculatory heater."
A small round sticker with a kangaroo logo was placed on the triangular panel between the door and the front body seam.
"I was too scared to drive a big car in London: the roads are so narrow and I'm always afraid I'm going to hit people on both sides."
The Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals.
In 1971, the Mini Cooper design was licensed in Italy by Innocenti and in 1973 to Spain by Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 and the Authi Mini Cooper 1300, respectively.
The new model made by BMW is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and "bulldog" stance of the original.
The Cooper name was discontinued from the UK Mini range at this time.
This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.

Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit "Wolseley" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance.
It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct ingress of rainwater through the grille.

About 50,000 were made in total, from 1964 to 1968 in the UK, 1966 to 1982 in Australia and 1983 to 1989 in Portugal.
The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach .
On introduction in August 1959 the Mini was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor.
The 1,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1965, with the 2,000,000th in 1969.
This was then followed by a number of later incremental developments:
A further title was the 1971 Sun-7 Chesterfield Series.
Slow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.
Very early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g.
From October 1965 the option of the unique Automotive Products (AP) designed four-speed automatic transmission became available.
Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini go kart-like handling.
A Mini was used to set a record at the Chateau Impney Hill Climb.
Full-width dashboard replaces the original shelf, internal bonnet release.
The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original "round-front" Mini design continued for another 20 years.
Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants.
Designated by Leonard Lord as project ADO15 ('''A'''malgamated '''D'''rawing '''O'''ffice project number '''15''') and the product of the Morris design team, the Mini came about because of a fuel shortage caused by the 1956 Suez Crisis.
The Mini was modified during its production to improve its safety.
They had assessed the mechanically interconnected Citroën 2CV suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''Car Magazine'' in the late 1990s),  which inspired the design of the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked.
* Mark VI (from 1990): the engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275&nbsp;cc power units, and includes the later HIF (Horizontal Integral Float) version of the SU (Skinners Union) carb, plus the single point fuel injected car which came out in 1991.
Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges.
The 1,275&nbsp;cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.
Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.
The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet.
Early domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 radials had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.
"Moke" is archaic British slang for a donkey.
A variety of Mini types were made in Pamplona, Spain, by the Authi company from 1968 onwards, mostly under the Morris name.
Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the Innocenti De Tomaso, that sported a 1275&nbsp;cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the "A" clutch instead of the "Verto" type.
Sales of the Mini Cooper were as follows: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997&nbsp;cc or 998&nbsp;cc engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970&nbsp;cc, 1,071&nbsp;cc or 1,275&nbsp;cc engines; 16,000 Mark II Coopers with 998&nbsp;cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1,275&nbsp;cc engines.
Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the U.S. importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market.
The Mini Van was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978, the number representing the gross vehicle weight of 0.95&nbsp;tons.
A more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the "S", was developed in tandem and released in 1963.
The Mini entered into popular culture in the 1960s with well-publicised purchases by film and music stars.
In 2012 a Mini broke the land speed record.
In 1969, a fibreglass version of the Mini Mark II was developed for British Leyland's Chilean subsidiary (British Leyland Automotores de Chile, S.A., originally the independent assembler EMSSA).
The sell-off was completed in May that year.
The Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper debuted in 1961.
The first example, a Morris Mini-Minor with the registration 621 AOK, is on display at the Heritage Motor Centre in Warwickshire.
This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same  disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275&nbsp;cc engine.
The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper "S," were successful as rally cars, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967.
As of 2014, classic Minis are still raced, with other one make races in the UK, Europe and Asia, and in classic events such as the Goodwood Members Meeting.
One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;– the '7' the letter V rotated left so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small Austin 7 of the 1920s and 1930s.

The disqualification related to the use of a variable resistance headlamp dimming circuit in place of a dual-filament lamp.
The Mini has won many awards over the years, perhaps the most notable include second place for ‘’Global’’ Car of the Century awarded in 1999, behind only the Model T Ford.
It continued to be sold in Canada until 1979.
Issigonis' friend John Cooper, owner of the Cooper Car Company and designer and builder of Formula One and rally cars, saw the potential of the Mini for competition.
It was distinctive in having wind-up windows and a swivelling quarterlight in Mk.I-style externally hinged doors.
To end Mini production in Australia, a limited edition runout model was produced − the 1275LS.
Faced with competitions from more practical and modern designs like the Ford Fiesta, Renault 5 and Volkswagen Polo, the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time.
Issigonis, who had been working for Alvis, had been recruited back to BMC in 1955 and, with his skills in designing small cars, was a natural for the task.
The Mark IV was introduced in 1976.
* Fourth prefix&nbsp;– series of model: 1&nbsp;– 1st series, 2&nbsp;– 2nd series, 3&nbsp;– 3rd series
Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971, and as the '''Leyland Mini''', without the Clubman name, from February 1973.
The 3,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1972, with the 4,000,000th in 1976.
The car featured a racing-tuned engine, twin SU carburettors, a closer-ratio gearbox and front disc brakes, uncommon at the time in a small car.
It was manufactured at the Longbridge and Cowley plants in England, the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Chile, Italy (Innocenti), Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
Lord, the somewhat autocratic head of BMC, reportedly detested these cars so much that he vowed to rid the streets of them and design a 'proper miniature car'.
The Chilean market was never very large and the hyperinflation and political and social collapse led to the 1973 coup The Arica plant was closed in 1974.
These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque.
The reason for the fibreglass body was to enable Leyland to meet very strict requirements for local sourcing, increasing to 70.22% in 1971.
The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller.
Introduction of airbag on driver's side.
Several times it was thought that safety regulations would stop Mini production  Safety improved in 1996, with the introduction of airbags and side-impact bars.
It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for BMW, which later bought the remnants of BMC as the Rover Group.
The 997&nbsp;cc engine was replaced by a shorter stroke 998&nbsp;cc unit in 1964.
A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille.
Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax.
This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for £1400.
Although the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and successor combine Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini.
The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world.
An internal bonnet release was fitted from 1992.
Ten-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to Dunlop.
Competition arrived with the more modern and practical Vauxhall Chevette of 1975, but the Mini continued to sell well until its "replacement"—the Metro—arrived in 1980.
30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.
The car competed as late as the 1979 Australian Rallycross Championship.
The fibreglass Mini built in Chile from 1970 until 1974 was not the only fibreglass version: in the summer of 1991, a fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production, this time in Venezuela.
The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates&nbsp;– the Mark II, the Clubman and the Mark III.
Codenamed ''Minki'' ("Mini" plus K-Series engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece rear door or tailgate instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, Hydragas suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.
The popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.
This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is Latin for "lesser", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for "least"&nbsp;– ''minimus''&nbsp;– was used for the new even smaller car.
* Mark V (from 1984): all cars had  brake discs and plastic wheel arches (Mini Special arches) but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape.
The cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement.
The name "Wolseley Hornet" was first used on 1930s saloon, coupé, sports and racing cars, while the name "Elf" recalled the Riley Sprite and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name "Imp" could not be used as Hillman had registered it).
The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959.
This layout required an extra gear between engine and transmission to reverse the direction of rotation at the input to the transmission.
The Mini was designed as a monocoque shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the A and C pillars, and between the body and the floor pan.
The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing.
Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals.
In 1980, the engine was uprated to the improved A-Plus unit from the Metro.
The highest price ever paid for a Mini was at a Bonhams auction in 2007, when a works rally-prepared Mini (DJB 93B) sold for £100,500 ($196,980).
Featuring a 1071&nbsp;cc engine with a 70.61&nbsp;mm bore and nitrided steel crankshaft and strengthened bottom end to allow further tuning; and larger servo-assisted disc brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964. Cooper also produced two S models specifically for circuit racing in the under 1,000&nbsp;cc and under 1,300&nbsp;cc classes respectively, rated at  and a , both had a  bore and both were also offered to the public.
The  engine from the Morris Mini-Minor was given a longer stroke to increase capacity to  increasing power from .
However, legal action was somehow averted, and BMC used the name "Mini" thereafter.
By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of £8.
Production of both models ceased in late 1969.
Within these was a series of variations, including an estate car, a pick-up truck, a van and the Mini Moke&nbsp;– a jeep-like buggy.
The Mini was marketed under BMC's two main brand names, Austin and Morris, until 1969, when it became a marque in its own right.
The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges.
The Mini also received awards for "Car of the Century" (''Autocar'' magazine 1995) and "Number One Classic Car of All Time" (''Classic & Sports Car'' magazine 1996).
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous "special editions" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon.
This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine.
Asked about the crashworthiness of the Mini he said ''"I make my cars with such good brakes, such good steering, that if people get into a crash it's their own fault"''.
In July 1965 BMC announced that following "comments by safety experts" about the Mini's external doorhandles, these would be modified on new cars so that the gap between the handle and the door panel would be effectively closed.
Initially an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis.
In the same competition, run by the prestigious Global Automotive Elections Foundation, the Mini was selected "European Car of the Century."
The Mini, challenged by increasingly demanding European safety and pollution standards, was planned by British Aerospace to be taken out of production in 1996, but BMW chose to invest to keep the Mini legal until the launch of a new model.
Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller,  wheels (even though he had already settled on ten-inch).
The engine size was reduced from ; this, in conjunction with a small increase in the car's width, cut the top speed from .

This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.
The driver of the Citroën, Pauli Toivonen, felt that he hadn't really "won" the rally.
In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist Roy Haynes, who had previously worked for Ford.
The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small: as well as Issigonis, there was Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students and four draughtsmen.
The suspension system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. Alex Moulton at Moulton Developments Limited, used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs.
A UK Department for Transport statistics publication, presenting estimates of the risk of driver injury in two-car injury collisions, based on reported road accident data, estimated that the 1990–2000 Mini was one of two small cars (the other being the Hyundai Atoz), which, with an estimated 84 per cent of drivers likely to be injured, presented the greatest risk of driver injury; the average risk for the small car category was 76 per cent.
The last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant.
The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962 and Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969.
The Canadian government applies a similar rule after 15 years.
The Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, Rover Group&nbsp;– the heirs to BMC&nbsp;– were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.
By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and—for overseas European markets—the Mini Knightsbridge.
Production of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated "lots of production changes" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's Cowley plant to the Longbridge plant: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.
In 1962, Rhodesian John Love became the first non-British racing driver to win the British Saloon Car Championship driving a Mini Cooper.
The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini, somewhat to the surprise of the Sharp's Commercials car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name Minicar for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.
The 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the "Mini Clubman 1275 GT".
Throughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 "round-front" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models.
The Cooper S version was also used by some British police departments as a plainclothes car.
It proved popular and a new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991.
Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini.
The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions.
BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money.
In January 2007 Which?
In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.
Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968.
It was the first Mini to be equipped with a tachometer.
A utility vehicle intended for the British Army was built with a twin-engined 4-wheel-drive.
Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows).
In April 1974 a heater became standard equipment on the entry level Mini 850 as well, having by now already been included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.
The car also won the Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship in 1998.
This increased the car's top speed from  .
"I love my Mini Cooper," remarked Madonna in 2003.
The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the Austin Maxi.
The car also won the 1961, 1962, 1969, 1978 and 1979 British Saloon Car Championship season, as well as the British Rally Championship in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the European Rally Championship in 1965 and 1966, and won the 1965 Lowood 4 Hour endurance race, and the final Finnish Grand Prix in 1963.
A new model, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971).
This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers.
1981 was the Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth.
Both the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions.
In the end 5.3&nbsp;million Minis were sold, making it the most popular British car ever made.
At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.
It also used homokinetic shafts instead of rubber couplings.
An agreement was made on the ten-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.
Another early example from 1959 is now on display at the National Motor Museum in Hampshire.
In 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new Motability scheme.
The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels.
The Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a sedan delivery) rated at ¼-ton load capacity.
The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design.
On early cars the number plate was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open.
There are over 120 Mini-based kit cars from various small companies and individual enthusiasts.
In rallycross, the Mini finished on the podium in the first ever race, at Lydden Hill Race Circuit in February 1967, winning races in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 1974 and 1975.
Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0– in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a  time in top gear of only nine seconds.
Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single  carburettor and  disc brakes.
+Monte Carlo Rally results for Mini.
The official name was always just the "Mini 1275 GT", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).
From the Mark IV onward, many special limited-production editions of the Mini were offered.
Today the U.S. Government exempts cars older than 25 years from all import laws, so older Minis can be freely imported.
* Second prefix letter&nbsp;– engine type: A
Initially, they used the   engine (engine type 8WR) with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor  version of the Cooper's  power unit (engine type 9WR) in the Mark II in 1963.
A total of 1,581,887 Minis were sold in Britain after its launch in 1959.
Twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals.
The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman).
A new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990–1991, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper.
In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the Innocenti 90 and 120, Bertone-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform.
521,494 were built.
Built in the Australian British Motor Corporation factory at Zetland, New South Wales, using 80% local content, the Morris Mini K was advertised as the "great leap forward".
Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a.
BMW acquired the Rover Group (formerly British Leyland) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the ''MINI'' name.
This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate.
A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.
Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option.
He laid down some basic design requirements: the car should be contained within a box that measured ; and the passenger accommodation should occupy  of the  length; and the engine, for reasons of cost, should be an existing unit.
Like the van, the Pick-up was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978.
