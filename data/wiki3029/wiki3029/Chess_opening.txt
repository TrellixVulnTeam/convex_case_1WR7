Worse possibilities either ignore the center and development such as 1.a3, weaken White's position (for instance, 1.f3 and 1.g4), or place the knights on poor squares (1.Na3 and 1.Nh3).
This idea was a doctrine of the Soviet school of chess.
; Attack : Sometimes used to describe an aggressive or provocative variation such as the Albin–Chatard Attack (or Chatard–Alekhine Attack), the Fried Liver Attack in the Two Knights Defense, and the Grob Attack.
In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd5.
Ruy Lopez's disagreement with Damiano regarding the merits of 2...Nc6 led to 3.Bb5 (after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6) being named for him as the Ruy Lopez or ''Spanish Opening''.
* 1.e4 d5 Scandinavian Defense (also known as the Center Counter defense)
Cities are also used, such as Vienna, Berlin, and Wilkes-Barre.
Rapid mobilization is the key.
This leads to openings such as Alekhine's Defense – in a line like 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4 (the ''Four Pawns Attack''), White has a formidable pawn center for the moment, but Black hopes to undermine it later in the game, leaving White's position exposed.
Larsen's Opening (1.b3) and the Sokolsky Opening (1.b4) are occasionally seen in grandmaster play.
The Queen's Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired.
The Catalan Opening is characterized by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing his king's bishop.
Some opening names honor two people, such as the Caro–Kann.
Other semi-open games have been studied but are less common; see Semi-Open Game for details.
gaining the bishop pair), or gaining a space advantage, whether in the centre or on the flanks.
# '''Control of the center''': At the start of the game, it is not clear on which part of the board the pieces will be needed.
# '''Create positions in which the player is more comfortable than the opponent''': Transposition is one common way of doing this.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Ruy Lopez
Some unbalanced openings for Black, in particular, make use of this idea, such as the Dutch and the Sicilian.
Of these, 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, and 1.c4 are by far the most popular as these moves do the most to promote rapid development and control of the center.
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD)
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 Grünfeld Defense
The Modern Benoni is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority.
* 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 Pirc Defense
The classical view is that central control is best effected by placing pawns there, ideally establishing pawns on d4 and e4 (or d5 and e5 for Black).
In addition to Opening, common terms include Game, Defense, Gambit, and Variation; less common terms are System, Attack, Counterattack, Countergambit, Reversed, and Inverted.
Fianchettos are common in many of these openings.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Italian Game
* 1.e4 e5 2.f4 King's Gambit
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 Benko Gambit (or Volga Gambit)
* 1.d4 d5 Double Queen's Pawn Opening or Closed Game
A small minority of openings are prefixed with "Anti-".
The beginning chess position offers White twenty possible first moves.
* 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, 7.e4 King's Indian Attack (KIA) (moves may be played in many different orders)
With Bird's Opening (1.f4) White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square.
The set of openings a player has specialized in is called an opening repertoire.
The study of openings can become unbalanced if it is to the exclusion of tactical training and middlegame and endgame strategy.
The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn.
An alternative is to sacrifice one or two pawns, for example in the Danish Gambit.
Black replies to the Queen's Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.
They are also examples of ''Systems'', rather than specific opening variations.
; System : A method of development that can be used against many different setups by the opponent.
Black's most popular replies are:
; Reversed, Inverted : A Black opening played by White, or more rarely a White opening played by Black.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 Philidor Defense
Advocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo-Indian Defence was the first of the Indian systems to gain full acceptance.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 Scotch Game
For example, in the main line of the Winawer Variation of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3), White will try to use his bishop pair and space advantage to mount an attack on Black's kingside, while Black will seek simplifying exchanges (in particular, trading off one of White's bishops to blunt this advantage) and counterattack against the weakened pawns on White's queenside; both players accept different combinations of advantages and disadvantages.
The most important Indian Defenses are listed below, but many others have been studied and played; see Indian Defense for details.
In fact, the KIA is probably most often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro–Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games which usually come after 1.e4 e5.
Defenses with an early ...d6 coupled with a kingside fianchetto are also commonly played.
There are many dozens of different openings, and hundreds of named variants.
Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in the closed games.
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 2.d5 e6 Modern Benoni
Thus, early chess books, such as the 1497 text of Luis Ramirez de Lucena, present opening analysis, as does Pedro Damiano (1512), and Ruy López de Segura (1561).
Examples include Sicilian Reversed (from the English Opening), and the Inverted Hungarian.
However, the hypermodern school showed that it was not always necessary or even desirable to occupy the center in this way, and that too broad a pawn front could be attacked and destroyed, leaving its architect vulnerable; an impressive-looking pawn center is worth little unless it can be maintained.
Some openings which are effective against amateur players are less effective at the master level.
''The Oxford Companion to Chess'' lists 1,327 named openings and variants.
An example is the Perenyi Attack of the Sicilian Defense (see diagram) which yields an immensely complicated and tactical position that even strong players have difficulty handling, and that is beyond the comprehension of most amateurs.
Defenses beginning with 1...c6 and 1...e6, often followed by the center thrust 2...d5, are also popular.
; Gambit : An opening that involves the sacrifice of material, usually one or more pawns.
Eponymic openings include the Ruy Lopez, Alekhine's Defense, Morphy Defense, and the Réti Opening.
* 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA)
The Philidor Defense (2...d6) is not popular in modern chess because it allows White an easy space advantage while Black's position remains cramped and passive, although solid.
On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an undefended square and weakens d4 and f4; the Hungarian master Gyula Breyer melodramatically declared that "After 1.e4 White's game is in its last throes."
Often Black adopts a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for White.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 Four Knights Game
The Pirc and the Modern are closely related openings that are also often seen, while the Alekhine and the Scandinavian have made occasional appearances in World Chess Championship games.
Black has twenty possible responses to White's opening move.
Unsound gambits are sometimes used as surprise weapons, but are unreliable for a stable repertoire.
Although Indian defenses were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Soviet players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black.
In some opening lines, the moves considered best for both sides have been worked out for twenty to twenty-five moves or more.
The English Opening (1.c4) also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including the Symmetrical Variation (1.c4 c5) and the Reversed Sicilian (1.c4 e5).
It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defenses to 1.d4 and White often adopts move orders designed to avoid it.
According to IM Jeremy Silman, the purpose of the opening is to create dynamic imbalances between the two sides, which will determine the character of the middlegame and the strategic plans chosen by both sides.
These openings have some similarities with each other, in particular the Bishop's Opening frequently transposes to variations of the Vienna Game.
It resembles a combination of the Queen's Gambit and Réti Opening.
The queen, and to a lesser extent the rooks, are not usually played to a central position until later in the game, when many minor pieces and pawns are no longer present.
# '''Prevention of pawn weakness''': Most openings strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled and backward pawns, pawn islands, etc.
* 2...e6, freeing the king's bishop and leading into the Nimzo-Indian Defence, Queen's Indian Defence, Bogo–Indian Defence, Modern Benoni, or regular lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined,
White develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend.
When kept secret until used in a competitive game it is often known as a ''prepared variation'', a powerful weapon in top-class competition.
A new sequence of moves in the opening is referred to as a ''theoretical novelty''.
* 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 Danish Gambit
; Game : Used only for some of the oldest openings, for example Scotch Game, Vienna Game, and Four Knights Game.
If Black mirrors White's move and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.
This practice became more common in the 20th century.
For example, Black obtains active play in return for a pawn in the Benko Gambit; amateur players may have trouble defending against Black's activity, while masters are more skilled at defending and making use of the extra pawn.
To this end, knights are usually developed to f3, c3, f6 and c6 (or sometimes e2, d2, e7 or d7), and both players' king and queen pawns are moved so the bishops can be developed (alternatively, the bishops may be ''fianchettoed'' with a maneuver such as g3 and Bg2).
The Benko Gambit is often played by strong players, and is very popular at lower levels.
The most important closed openings are in the Queen's Gambit family (White plays 2.c4).
The Indian systems (1.d4 Nf6) are the most important of the Semi-Closed Games, and warrant separate treatment.
The King's Gambit was extremely popular in the 19th century.
; Variation : Usually used to describe a line within a more general opening, for example the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined.
* 1.f4 Bird's Opening
The Sokolsky Opening 1.b4 and the King's and Queen's fianchettos: Larsen's Opening 1.b3 and 1.g3 aid development a bit, but they only address center control peripherally and are slower than the more popular openings.
Its greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.
A simple descriptive categorization of the chess opening is King's Pawn Openings, Queen's Pawn Openings, and Others.
The Catalan System is named after the Catalonia region of Spain.
Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Grünfeld intended it as an improvement to the King's Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time.
* Single Queen Pawn or Semi-Closed Games (1.d4 other)
The hypermoderns instead advocated controlling the center from a distance with pieces, breaking down one's opponent's center, and only taking over the center oneself later in the game.
Since then, Indian defenses have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for both sides.
The term "defense" does not imply passivity; many defenses are quite aggressive (such as the King's Indian Defence).
The characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in many different orders.
Opening nomenclature developed haphazardly, and most names are historical accidents not based on systematic principles.
Other responses to 2.Nf3 are not seen in master play.
White will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack.
The Grünfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov.
Some openings sacrifice endgame considerations for a quick attack on the opponent's position.
These reference works often present these move sequences in simple algebraic notation, opening trees, or theory tables.
Some openings have been given fanciful names, often names of animals.
Consider some of the openings named for nationalities: Scotch Game, English Opening, French Defense, and Russian Game—the Scotch Game and the English Opening are both White openings (White chooses to play), the French is indeed a defense but so is the Russian Game.
Black's most common reply is 2...Nc6, which usually leads to the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5), Scotch Game (3.d4), or Italian Game (3.Bc4).
A '''chess opening''' is the group of initial moves of a chess game.
The Dunst Opening, 1.Nc3, develops a knight to a good square, but is somewhat inflexible because it blocks White's c-pawn; also, after 1...d5 the knight is liable to be driven to an inferior square by ...d4.
A very narrow repertoire allows for deeper specialization but also makes a player less flexible to vary against different opponents.
Karpov is a leading expert in this opening.
The Colle System and Stonewall Attack are classified as Queen's Pawn Games because White plays d4 but not c4.
* 1.e4 Nf6 Alekhine's Defense
The opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!?
* 1.c4 English Opening
Many openings are named after nationalities, for example Indian, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Scotch, Russian, Italian, Scandinavian, and Sicilian.
White starts by playing 1.e4 (moving his king pawn two spaces).
However, control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
* 2...c5 3.d5 e6, the Modern Benoni, with an immediate counterpunch in the center.
* 1.e4 e5 Double King's Pawn Opening or Open Game
* 1.e4 c6 Caro–Kann Defense
When a game begins to deviate from known opening theory, the players are said to be "out of book".
Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well.
A few other opening moves are considered reasonable but less consistent with opening principles than the four most popular moves.
Professional chess players spend years studying openings, and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve.
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Catalan Opening
; Countergambit : A gambit played in response to another gambit, almost always by Black.
; Defense : Always refers to an opening chosen by Black, such as Two Knights Defense or King's Indian Defense, unless, of course, it has 'reversed' in front of it, which makes it an opening for White.
It is therefore common for both players either to castle in the opening (simultaneously developing one of the rooks) or to otherwise bring the king to the side of the board via artificial castling.
The most popular second move for White is 2.Nf3 attacking Black's king pawn, preparing for a kingside castle, and anticipating the advance of the queen pawn to d4.
This is usually done by transpositions, in which a game that apparently starts with one opening can reach a position that is normally produced by a different opening.
Measures must be taken to reduce his vulnerability.
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 Nimzo-Indian Defence
; Opening : Along with Variation, this is the most common term.
* 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 Petrov's Defense
* 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 Colle System
The Queen's Gambit is not a true gambit because there is no good way for Black to keep the pawn .
To make matters more confusing, these terms are used very inconsistently.
(Note that after 1.Nf3 the analogous 1...e5?
In the Center Game (2.d4) White immediately opens the center but if the pawn is to be recovered after 2...exd4, White must contend with a slightly premature queen development after 3.Qxd4.
In the semi-open games White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5.
Examples of this include the Albin Countergambit to the Queen's Gambit, the Falkbeer Countergambit to the King's Gambit, and the Greco Counter Gambit (the former name of the Latvian Gambit).
Although these do not have precise definitions, here are some general observations about how they are used.
Apart from these ideas, other strategies used in the middlegame may also be carried out in the opening.
* As White, whether to open with 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4, or 1.Nf3
Alekhine's, the Pirc and the Modern are hypermodern openings in which Black tempts White to build a large center with the goal of attacking it with pieces.
This is the most popular opening move and it has many strengths—it immediately works on controlling the center, and it frees two pieces (the queen and a bishop).
In addition, opponents may find it easier to prepare against a player with a narrow repertoire.
Black often chooses the Queen's Indian when White avoids the Nimzo-Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3.
* Unusual first moves for White
Other openings, such as the Alekhine and the Benoni, invite the opponent to overextend and form pawn weaknesses.
Since the Catalan can be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen's Gambit Declined-like move sequence is 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.
The most important scheme of classifying chess openings for serious players is by ECO code, a series of 500 opening codes assigned by the ''Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings''.
Although these codes are invaluable for the serious study of the chess opening, they are not very practical for a broad survey of the chess opening as the codes obscure common structural features between related openings.
A few opening names are descriptive, such as Giuoco Piano ().
These include preparing pawn breaks to create counterplay, creating weaknesses in the opponent's pawn structure, seizing control of key squares, making favourable exchanges of minor pieces (e.g.
The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4.
Some openings which are played between grandmasters are so complex and theoretical that amateur players will have trouble understanding them.
Therefore, most players specialize in certain openings where they know the theory and which lead to positions which they favor.
Gambits can be played by White (e.g., King's Gambit) or Black (e.g., Latvian Gambit).
In still other cases the name seems to be used ironically, as with the fairly inoffensive Durkin's Attack (also called the Durkin Opening).
* 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 Queen's Indian Defense
In other cases it refers to a defensive system by Black when adopted by White, as in King's Indian Attack.
* Double King Pawn, Symmetric or Open Games (1.e4 e5)
Many other variations after 1.e4 e5 have been studied; see Open Game for details.
Among the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker's Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses.
Descriptive names are less common than openings named for places and people.
Since these categories are still individually very large, it is common to divide each of them further.
White often chooses instead either to decline the gambit pawn or return it.
Many of these are mirror images of the most popular first moves for White, but with one less tempo.
* 1.Nf3 Zukertort Opening (characteristically followed by fianchettoing one or both bishops, and without an early d4)
Many terms are used for the opening as well.
Some analysis goes to thirty or thirty-five moves, as in the classical King's Indian Defense and in the Sveshnikov and Najdorf variations of the Sicilian Defense.
* 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4 (a typical move sequence) Stonewall Attack
Repertoires often change as a player develops, and a player's advancement may be stifled if the opening repertoire does not evolve.
* 1.b3 Larsen's Opening
The Queen's Indian Defense is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish.
One reasonable way to group the openings is:
Chess players' names are the most common sources of opening names.
The most popular Black defense to 1.e4 is the Sicilian (1...c5), but the French (1...e6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) and the Caro–Kann (1...c6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) are also very popular.
Both systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn, but are rarely used by professionals because a well-prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily.
# '''Development''': One of the main aims of the opening is to mobilize the pieces on useful squares where they will have impact on the game.
Specific openings accept pawn weaknesses in exchange for compensation in the form of dynamic play.
These are openings intended to avoid a particular line otherwise available to one's opponent, for example the Anti-Marshall (against the Marshall (Counter) Attack in the Ruy Lopez) and the Anti-Meran Gambit (against the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense).
The Sicilian and French Defenses lead to unbalanced positions that can offer exciting play with both sides having chances to win.
Players at the club level also study openings but the importance of the opening phase is smaller there since games are rarely decided in the opening.
(See Pawn structure.)
Since about the 1950s another objective has gradually become more dominant.
The King's Indian Defense is aggressive, somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be satisfied with a draw.
The Vienna Game also frequently features attacks on the Black center by means of a f2–f4 pawn advance.
Black plays to open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure.
The Caro–Kann Defense is solid as Black intends to use his c-pawn to support his center (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5).
