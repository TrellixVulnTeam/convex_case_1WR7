In 1858, the Kennington Oval introduced the first mobile scorebox, "a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side".
He can be dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is "out of his ground".
In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it.
This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.
In matches which are not ''limited overs'' there is also the possibility of a ''draw'': the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends, usually because time has run out.
The statistical record is so central to the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick came to be known as Father of Baseball, and was an early inductee in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
National championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy (India), Plunket Shield (New Zealand), Currie Cup (South Africa) and Shell Shield (West Indies).
The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).
Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically.
Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position.
Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.
As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased.
The cricket ''field'' is usually circular or oval in shape, with a rectangular ''pitch'' at the centre.
The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar) from a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the "Free School at Guildford", fifty years earlier, "hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play on the common land at creckett and other plaies."
In this league competition is between the top domestic teams from major cricketing nations.
If he does so he can only be dismissed by being ''run out''.
The fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field.
Welsh players are eligible to play for England, which is in effect an England and Wales team.
Typically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day.
The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later if he recovers.
Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings.
There have been many cricket films.
Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their minds, and return to their original positions.
There was further calls for subsequent Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games.
A batsman can be run out on a No ball, but cannot be stumped.
In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's ''Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury'' (1907) and Russell Drysdale's ''The Cricketers'' (1948), which has been called "possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century."
It is typically played on modified cricket fields.
To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground ''en route'' to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary.
Games are limited by either time or overs.
Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats, varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last.
In some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.
The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk.
The game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions.
# '''Hit the ball twice''' is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders.
If the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket – out ''stumped''.
The term "Bradmanesque" from Don Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.
# A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches)
In 1998, cricket was played as part of the Commonwealth Games, on this occasion in the 50-over format.
These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground.
Subsequent events have been held which were won by Pakistan (2009), England (2010), West Indies (2012), and Sri Lanka (2014).
The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.
This is also described as ''breaking'', ''knocking down'', or ''hitting'' the wicketthough if the ball hits the wicket but does ''not'' dislodge a bail or stump then it is ''not'' considered to be down.
A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a slower, higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot.
# '''Caught''': the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side.
For a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure.
The pitch is a flat surface  wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses.
All eleven players on the fielding side take the field together.
Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings.
However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield.
Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball.
If it is caught by the bowler then he is ''caught and bowled''; by the wicket keeper, ''caught behind''.
In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been introduced.
The ball becomes ''live'' when he starts his ''run up''.
The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out.
In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still "not out" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.
At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately.
In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised cricket as a sport which could apply to be included in the Olympic Games, but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the BCCI.
In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states.
He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped.
When the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is ''dead'', and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again.
Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.
If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt ''extra'' runs : these are called ''byes''.
This rule, seen only in impromptu games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball.
When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e.
are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over.
Cricket was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, when England and France contested a two-day match.
After a bowler has bowled six times (an ''over''), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position.
The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.
It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals.
If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side.
Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g.
If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by ''n'' wickets", where ''n'' is the number of wickets left to fall.
The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen "in".
The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side.
but not the bat, nor a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps.
The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.
In 1969, a national league competition was established.
In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was responsible for the "development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball".
A team consists of eleven players.
The game underwent major development in the 18th century.
* Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the batsman was out.
Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler.
A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers.
Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket).
However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression "How's that" (or "Howzat") (although often the batsman will immediately walk away without the need for an appeal).
# '''Wide''': a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled.
After the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were born.
The classifications, as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing.
In the case of Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.
The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase "it's just not cricket" was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life.
Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins laid over the wicket, elevated covers on wheels (acting like an umbrella) or even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket.
The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than , is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands, a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area).
* Overs (O): The number of overs bowled.
Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours.
It is extremely popular in the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues.
Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion.
The next World Cup will be hosted by England and Wales in 2019.
the "striker") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball.
It is believed that cricket was originally a children's game but references around 1610 indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards.
"normally reduced to ''howzat?''
Since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes.
(Sometimes when one of the two batsmen is a much stronger player than the other, he tries to score a single run from the last ball of the over so that he can remain "on strike".)
If the winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to "win by five wickets".
In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.
If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is ''dismissed'' and is said to be ''bowled out''.
Otherwise he will shake his head and say "Not out".
The batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat.
Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball.
If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points (''runs'') for their team.
Unlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape.
The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings.
The common forms of dismissal are "bowled", "caught", "leg before wicket" (lbw), "run out", and (somewhat less common) "stumped".
This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ''ground'' behind the crease.
# '''Run out''': a member of the fielding side has broken or "put down" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this occurs either by an accurate throw to the wicket, or more commonly by a throw to the wicketkeeper or other fielder standing near the wicket, while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out "run out" even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground.
One possible source for the name is the Old English ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff.
The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues.
Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile.
Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a "leg break" and a "Googly".
In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England.
Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it "curves" or "swings" in flight.
The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch.
A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs.
BCCI then formed its official league called the Indian Premier League.
The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC to participate in the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games, but the ICC turned down the invitation.
The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team.
* Centuries (100): The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.
Another member of the fielding team, the ''wicket keeper'', is positioned behind the striker's wicket.
A dismissed batsman must leave the field, and a teammate replaces him at the crease.
If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a ''leg bye''.
In the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport, played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike.
These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.
This batsman is termed "not out".
Organized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports.
This has a major effect on strategy: a team will often ''declare'' their innings closed when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs.
A batsman when dismissed is said to be "out" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team.
By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal.
Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks.
The original idea, when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was to provide workers with an evening entertainment.
The batsman at the bowling end is called the ''non-striker'', and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease.
Adjudication is performed on the field by two umpires.
The eleventh – '''retired out''' – is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.
The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result.
# '''Hit wicket''': a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball.
* Run rate (RR): Is the number of runs a batsman (or the batting side) scores in an over of six balls.
Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler.
The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner.
Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.
The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope.
Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting.
The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be  apart.
In some matches, particularly Test matches, either team may request a ''review'' by a ''third umpire'' who can use a ''decision review system'' (DRS), which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as ''Hawk-Eye'', ''Hot Spot'' and the ''Snickometer''.
If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an "edge".
A cricket match is divided into periods called ''innings'' (which ends with "s" in both singular and plural form).
* Balls faced (BF): The total number of balls received, including no balls but not including wides.
Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches.
If the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs.
This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat.
In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two "not out" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.
The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least .
In the West Indies these matters are addressed by the West Indies Cricket Board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards.
The exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space.
An innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to "declare" the innings closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time.
As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused.
In all forms of cricket, if a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him.
A batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can "leave" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper.
At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area.
Cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the "Spirit of the Game".
Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery.
The most successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles.
Standard limited overs cricket was introduced in England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs.
The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865.
There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks.
At any instant each batsman "owns" a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is ''in his ground''.
This is a high level of sportsmanship, as sometimes a batsman could take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions.
Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually.
The official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League has been disbanded.
There is always an ''umpire'' at each end of the pitch.
In the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain could previously allow another member of the batting side to be a runner.
In addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball.
This means that in the event of heavy rain, a match may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield.
One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible.
# '''Stumped''' is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run.
In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to "walk" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out.
The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained, during their one or two innings.
The batsmen might have started running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs do not count.
True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.
The basic batting statistics include:
Rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game.
Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed "green" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce.
The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.
Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit of the game.
To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump.
If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have "lost by ''n'' runs" (where ''n'' is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams).
At each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a ''wicket''; the two wickets are placed  apart.
Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.
In the rare event that the two teams both complete their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a ''tie''.
The umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues.
Running is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e.
the ball hits, and is deflected by, the glove and can then be caught).
In practice, matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather.
