''Jones v Apfel'' (1997) stated (quoting from ''Attorney's Textbook of Medicine'') that Rorschach "results do not meet the requirements of standardization, reliability, or validity of clinical diagnostic tests, and interpretation thus is often controversial".
The APA has also raised concerns that the dissemination of test materials might impose "very concrete harm to the general public".
The first one studied negative attitudes towards the test generated during the Wikipedia-Rorschach debate, while the second suggested that reading the Wikipedia article could help to fake "good" results in the test.
In particular, discrepancies seemed to focus on indices measuring narcissism, disordered thinking, and discomfort in close relationships.
'''Card VII''' can be associated with femininity (the human figures commonly seen in it being described as women or children), and function as a "mother card", where difficulties in responding may be related to concerns with the female figures in the subject's life.
In surveys, the use of Rorschach ranges from a low of 20% by correctional psychologists to a high of 80% by clinical psychologists engaged in assessment services, and 80% of psychology graduate programs surveyed teach it.
It is the second most widely used test by members of the Society for Personality Assessment, and it is requested by psychiatrists in 25% of forensic assessment cases, usually in a battery of tests that often include the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III.
It was not until 1939 that the test was used as a projective test of personality, a use of which Rorschach had always been skeptical.
They believed that the Exner scoring system was in need of an update, but after Exner's death, the Exner family forbade any changes to be made to the Comprehensive System.
On the other hand, symmetry makes conditions the same for right and left handed subjects; furthermore, it facilitates interpretation for certain blocked subjects.
This is to facilitate a "relaxed but controlled atmosphere".
James Heilman, an emergency room physician involved in the debate, compared it to the publication of the eye test chart: though people are likewise free to memorize the eye chart before an eye test, its general usefulness as a diagnostic tool for eyesight has not diminished.
The cited language differences mean that it's imperative for the test to be administered in the subject's native language or a very well mastered second language, and, conversely, the examiner should master the language used in the test.
He gives this explanation for the decision:
The protocols represent data gathered in the United States, Europe, Israel, Argentina and Brazil.
animal: not cat or dog
William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book ''Big Secrets'', where he also described the method of administering the test.
It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where  patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.
In the 1959 edition of ''Mental Measurement Yearbook'', Lee Cronbach (former President of the Psychometric Society and American Psychological Association) is quoted in a review: "The test has repeatedly failed as a prediction of practical criteria.
It is not, however, a card that is usually difficult for the subject to handle, having readily available popular responses.
There are ten official inkblots, each printed on a separate white card, approximately 18 by 24&nbsp;cm in size.
Each of the blots has near perfect bilateral symmetry.
The Exner system of scoring (also known as the "Comprehensive System") is meant to address this, and has all but displaced many earlier (and less consistent) scoring systems.
They presented an international collaborative study of 4704 Rorschach protocols, obtained in 21 different samples, across 17 different countries, with only 2% showing significant elevations on the index of perceptual and thinking disorder, 12% elevated on indices of depression and hyper-vigilance and  13% elevated on persistent stress overloadâ€”all in line with expected frequencies among nonpatient populations.
This conclusion was challenged in studies using large samples reported in 2002.
The underlying assumption is that an individual will class external stimuli based on person-specific perceptual sets, and including needs, base motives, conflicts, and that this clustering process is representative of the process used in real-life situations.
"form-color" implies a more refined control of impulse than "color-form").
The most widely used method in the United States is based on the work of Exner.
In custody cases, 23% of psychologists use the Rorschach to examine a child.
It makes heavy use of what factor (shading, color, outline, etc.)
After compiling protocols for over a decade, a total of 15 adult samples were used to provide a normative basis for the R-PAS.
Rorschach scoring systems have been described as a system of pegs on which to hang one's knowledge of personality.
Benjamin Radford, editor of ''Skeptical Inquirer'' magazine, stated that the Rorschach "has remained in use more out of tradition than good evidence" and was hopeful that publication of the test might finally hasten its demise.
Exner's system was thought to possess normative scores for various populations.
In terms of updated scoring, the authors only selected variables that have been empirically supported in the literature.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
In addition, major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes (p.&nbsp;154): "Though tens of thousands of Rorschach tests have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time (of a previous review), and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized, the vast majority of these relationships ''have never been validated empirically'', despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test."
Asymmetric figures are rejected by many subjects; symmetry supplied part of the necessary artistic composition.
Using the scores for these categories, the examiner then performs a series of calculations producing a structural summary of the test data.
After studying 300 mental patients and 100 control subjects, in 1921 Rorschach wrote his book ''Psychodiagnostik'', which was to form the basis of the inkblot test (after experimenting with several hundred inkblots, he selected a set of ten for their diagnostic value), but he died the following year.
Hogrefe & Huber Publishing, a German company that sells editions of the plates, called the publication "unbelievably reckless and even cynical of Wikipedia" and said it was investigating the possibility of legal action.
Texture is the dominant characteristic of '''card VI''', which often elicits association related to interpersonal closeness; it is specifically a "sex card", its likely sexual percepts being reported more frequently than in any other card, even though other cards have a greater variety of commonly seen sexual contents.
The Chapmans investigated the source of the testers' false confidence.
The interpretation of a Rorschach record is a complex process.
Although skeptical about its scientific validity, some psychologists use it in therapy and coaching "as a way of encouraging self-reflection and starting a conversation about the person's internal world."
Similarly, the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time-consuming leaving them very subject to the author's style and the publisher to the quality of the instructions (such as was noted with one of Bohm's textbooks in the 1950s) as well as clinic workers (which would include examiners) being encouraged to cut corners.
A related phenomenon called "invisible correlation" applies when people fail to see a strong association between two events because it does not match their expectations.
Administration of the test to a group of subjects, by means of projected images, has also occasionally been performed, but mainly for research rather than diagnostic purposes.
Test administration is not to be confused with test interpretation:
Rorschach never intended the inkblots to be used as a general personality test, but developed them as a tool for the diagnosis of  schizophrenia.
The Chapmans repeated this experiment with another set of cards, in which the association was negative; the five signs were never reported by homosexuals.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
Supporters of the Rorschach inkblot test believe that the subject's response to an ambiguous and meaningless stimulus can provide insight into their thought processes, but it is not clear ''how'' this occurs.
of the inkblot leads to each of the tested person's comments.
Homosexual men are more likely to see a monster on Card IV or a part-animal, part-human figure in Card V. Almost all of the experienced clinicians in the Chapmans' survey missed these valid signs.
bat, butterfly, moth
crab, lobster, spider
Therefore, they established a new system: the R-PAS.
In other words, side-by-side seating mitigates the possibility that the examiner will accidentally influence the subject's responses.
He was so impressed that he started a craze for the test that has never diminished.
The Exner system remains very popular in the United States, while in Europe other methods sometimes dominate, such as that described in the textbook by Evald Bohm, which is closer to the original Rorschach system and rooted more deeply in the original psychoanalysis principles.
The key components of the Exner system are the clusterization of Rorschach variables and a sequential search strategy to determine the order in which to analyze them, framed in the context of standardized administration, objective, reliable coding and a representative normative database.
... Its value as a measure of thought disorder in schizophrenia research is well accepted.
These complaints were denied.
They have been in the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law.
This card can induce a variety of sexual responses.
cites many court cases where these had not been followed.
Some systems are based on the psychoanalytic concept of object relations.
Exner and others have claimed that the Rorschach test is capable of detecting suicidality.
Some critics argue that the testing psychologist must also project onto the patterns.
In the 1960s, research by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman showed that at least some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion.
Rorschach's, however, was the first systematic approach of this kind.
But with the Exner system of scoring, much of the subjectivity is eliminated or reduced by use of frequency tables that indicate how often a particular response is given by the population in general.
The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach.
Although Rorschach proponents, such as Hibbard, suggest that high rates of pathology detected by the Rorschach accurately reflect increasing psychopathology in society, the Rorschach also identifies half of all test-takers as possessing "distorted thinking", a false positive rate unexplained by current research.
(Cancer is mentioned because a small minority of Rorschach enthusiasts have claimed the test can predict cancer.)
Third parties could be used to avoid this problem, but the Rorschach's inter-rater reliability has been questioned.
As pertains to response form, a concept of "form quality" was present from the earliest of Rorschach's works, as a subjective judgment of how well the form of the subject's response matched the inkblots (Rorschach would give a higher form score to more "original" yet good form responses), and this concept was followed by other methods, especially in Europe; in contrast, the Exner system solely defines "good form" as a matter of word occurrence frequency, reducing it to a measure of the subject's distance to the population average.
More than any other feature in the test, content response can be controlled consciously by the subject, and may be elicited by very disparate factors, which makes it difficult to use content alone to draw any conclusions about the subject's personality; with certain individuals, content responses may potentially be interpreted directly, and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the whole set of content responses (which is only feasible when several responses are available), but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record.
The American Psychological Association (APA) has a code of ethics that supports "freedom of inquiry and expression" and helping "the public in developing informed judgments".
In particular, information about ''determinants'' (the aspects of the inkblots that triggered the response, such as form and color) and ''location'' (which details of the inkblots triggered the response) is often considered more important than content, although there is contrasting evidence.
This allows generalizations to be made between someone's responses to the cards and their actual behavior.
Huber has remained the publisher of the test and related book, with Rorschach a registered trademark of Swiss publisher Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.
Psychologists have sometimes refused to disclose tests and test data to courts when asked to do so by the parties citing ethical reasons; it is argued that such refusals may hinder full understanding of the process by the attorneys, and impede cross-examination of the experts.

At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology, and the Rorschach was the most popular projective test.
This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose.
Many psychologists in the United Kingdom do not trust its efficacy and it is rarely used.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
In his 1998 book ''Ethics in Psychology'', Gerald Koocher notes that some believe "reprinting copies of the Rorschach plates ... and listing common responses represents a serious unethical act" for psychologists and is indicative of "questionable professional judgment".
Later that year two psychologists filed a complaint against Heilman with the Saskatchewan medical licensing board, arguing that his uploading of the images constituted unprofessional behavior.
It is still used, however, by such prestigious mental health organisations as the Tavistock Clinic.
It claims that its goals include "the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work", and it requires that psychologists "make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and security of test materials".
Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity, Complexity, Form Quality, and Human Figure responses.
A possible example sometimes attributed to the psychologist's subjective judgement is that responses are coded (among many other things), for "Form Quality": in essence, whether the subject's response fits with how the blot actually looks.
Several scores correlate well with general intelligence.
After the test subject has seen and responded to all of the inkblots (''free association'' phase), the tester then presents them again one at a time in a set sequence for the subject to study: the subject is asked to note where he sees what he originally saw and what makes it look like that (''inquiry'' phase).
There are 27 established codes for identifying the name of the descriptive object.
Disagreements about test validity remain: while the Exner proposed a rigorous scoring system, latitude remained in the actual interpretation, and the clinician's write-up of the test record is still partly subjective.
Reber (1985) describes the blots as merely ".. the vehicle for the interaction .." between client and therapist, concluding: ".. the usefulness of the Rorschach will depend upon the sensitivity, empathy and insightfulness of the tester totally independently of the Rorschach itself.
The R-PAS also recognized that scoring on many of the Rorschach variables differed across countries.
There is only one popular response, and it is the least frequent of all cards.
In 1992, the psychologist Stuart Sutherland argued that these artificial experiments are easier than the real-world use of the Rorschach, and hence they probably underestimated the errors that testers were susceptible to.
While all of these codes have been used in the past, many have been renamed to be more face valid and readily understood.
Rorschach experimented with both asymmetric and symmetric images before finally opting for the latter.
The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them.
Nevertheless, there is substantial research indicating the utility of the measure for a few scores.
The students still reported seeing a strong positive correlation.
The same statement quotes their president as saying, "The CPA's concern is not with the publication of the cards and responses to the Rorschach test per se, for which there is some controversy in the psychological literature and disagreement among experts, but with the larger issue of the publication and dissemination of psychological test content".
Lilienfeld and colleagues, who are critical of the Rorschach, have stated that this proves that the Rorschach tends to "overpathologise normals".
That is, in some studies the scores obtained by two independent scorers do not match with great consistency.
But, beginning in the mid-1990s others began to try to replicate or update these norms and failed.
The administrator and subject typically sit next to each other at a table, with the administrator slightly behind the subject.
More than one determinant can contribute to the formation of the subject's percept, and fusion of two determinants is taken into account, while also assessing which of the two constituted the primary contributor (e.g.
When seeing '''card I''', subjects often inquire on how they should proceed, and questions on what they are allowed to do with the card (e.g.
There were many different methods for coding the areas of the blots.
Interviewed in 2012 for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Rita Signer, curator of the Rorschach Archives in Bern, Switzerland, suggested that far from being random or chance designs, each of the blots selected by Rorschach for his test had been meticulously designed to be as ambiguous and "conflicted" as possible.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
(1999) where under cross examination Dr. Bogacki stated under oath "many psychologists do not believe much in the validity or effectiveness of the Rorschach test" and ''US v Battle'' (2001) ruled that the Rorschach "does not have an objective scoring system."
Despite these beliefs, analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were just as likely to report these signs, which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality.
The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men.
Five inkblots are of black ink, two are of black and red ink and three are multicolored, on a white background.
Exner settled upon the area coding system promoted by S. J. Beck (1944 and 1961).
The results of the structural summary are interpreted using existing research data on personality characteristics that have been demonstrated to be associated with different kinds of responses.
The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that, "Publishing the questions and answers to any psychological test compromises its usefulness" and calls for "keeping psychological tests out of the public domain."
Being the first card, it can provide clues about how subjects tackle a new and stressful task.
Identifying the location of the subject's response is another element scored in the Rorschach system.
The five signs did, however, match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality.
The center detail is relatively often (though not popularly) identified as a vagina, which makes this card also relate to feminine sexuality in particular.
utilizing percentiles and standard scores) to make the Rorschach more in line with other popular personality measures.

Scoring of the indices has been updated (e.g.
Another controversial aspect of the test is its statistical norms.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
Controversy ensued in the psychological community in 2009 when the original Rorschach plates and research results on interpretations were published in the "Rorschach test" article on Wikipedia.
It is an attempt at creating a current, empirically based, and internationally focused scoring system that is easier to use than Exner's Comprehensive System.
D is interpreted as one having efficient or adequate functioning.
It has not taken a position on publication of the Rorschach plates but noted  "there are a limited number of standardized psychological tests considered appropriate for a given purpose".
Reber (1985) comments ".. there is essentially no evidence whatsoever that the test has even a shred of validity."
After Rorschach's death, the original test scoring system was improved by Samuel Beck, Bruno Klopfer and others.
In the system, responses are scored with reference to their level of vagueness or synthesis of multiple images in the blot, the location of the response, which of a variety of determinants is used to produce the response (i.e., what makes the inkblot look like what it is said to resemble), the form quality of the response (to what extent a response is faithful to how the actual inkblot looks), the contents of the response (what the respondent actually sees in the blot), the degree of mental organizing activity that is involved in producing the response, and any illogical, incongruous, or incoherent aspects of responses.

"Popularity" and "originality" of responses can also be considered as basic dimensions in the analysis.
Using interpretation of "ambiguous designs" to assess an individual's personality is an idea that goes back to Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli.
In one experiment, students read through a stack of cards, each with a Rorschach blot, a sign and a pair of "conditions" (which might include homosexuality).
The general goal of the test is to provide data about cognition and personality variables such as motivations, response tendencies, cognitive operations, affectivity, and personal/interpersonal perceptions.
Therefore, starting in 1997, Rorschach protocols from researchers around the world were compiled.

Dana&nbsp;(France):
Other professional associations, such as the Italian Association of Strategic Psychotherapy, recommend that even information about the purpose of the test or any detail of its administration should be kept from the public, even though "cheating" the test is held to be practically impossible.
Others however have found that its usage by forensic psychologists has decreased.
Forensic psychologists use the Rorschach 36% of the time.
There is nothing in the literature to encourage reliance on Rorschach interpretations."
Shortly after publication of Rorschach's book, a copy found its way to Japan where it was discovered by one of the country's leading psychiatrists in a second-hand book store.
Therefore, people who find processing complex situations or emotional stimuli distressing or difficult may be uncomfortable with this card.
He later published a study in multiple volumes called ''The Rorschach: A Comprehensive system'', the most accepted full description of his system.
Due to this controversy an   was temporarily established on Wikipedia to prevent the removal of the plates.
Dana&nbsp;(France):
The codes are classified and include terms such as "human", "nature", "animal", "abstract", "clothing", "fire", and "x-ray", to name a few.
In a survey done in the year 2000, 20% of correctional psychologists used the Rorschach while 80% used the MMPI.
Controversy over Wikipedia's publication of the inkblots has resulted in the blots being published in other locations, such as ''The Guardian'' and ''The Globe and Mail''.
Interestingly, one such scale is R, the total number of responses; this reveals the questionable side-effect that more intelligent people tend to be elevated on many pathology scales, since many scales do not correct for high R: if a subject gives twice as many responses overall, it is more likely that some of these will seem "pathological".
Methods of interpretation differ.
It is also thought that the test's reliability can depend substantially on details of the testing procedure, such as where the tester and subject are seated, any introductory words, verbal and nonverbal responses to subjects' questions or comments, and how responses are recorded.
The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality.
From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test images have been in the public domain for many years in most countries, particularly those with a copyright term of up to 70 years ''post mortem auctoris''.
Some skeptics consider the Rorschach inkblot test pseudoscience, as several studies suggested that conclusions reached by test administrators since the 1950s were akin to cold reading.
The interpretation of the Rorschach test is not based primarily on the contents of the response, i.e., ''what'' the individual sees in the inkblot (the ''content'').
Test responses should also not be translated into another language prior to analysis except possibly by a clinician mastering both languages.
Publication of the Rorschach images is also welcomed by critics who consider the test to be pseudoscience.
French psychologist Alfred Binet had also experimented with inkblots as a creativity test, and, after the turn of the century, psychological experiments where inkblots were utilized multiplied, with aims such as studying imagination and consciousness.
An intense dialogue about the wallpaper or the rug would do as well provided that both parties believe."
'''Card III''' is typically perceived to contain two humans involved in some interaction, and may provide information about how the subject relates with other people (specifically, response latency may reveal struggling social interactions).
'''Card IV''' is notable for its dark color and its shading (posing difficulties for depressed subjects), and is generally perceived as a big and sometimes threatening figure; compounded with the common impression of the subject being in an inferior position ("looking up") to it, this serves to elicit a sense of authority.
The ''Exner scoring system'', also known as the ''Rorschach Comprehensive System'' (RCS), is the standard method for interpreting the Rorschach test.
'''Card X''' is structurally similar to card VIII, but its uncertainty and complexity are reminiscent of card IX: people who find it difficult to deal with many concurrent stimuli may not particularly like this otherwise pleasant card.
A striking characteristic of the Rorschach inkblots is their symmetry.
Items are also coded for statistical popularity (or, conversely, originality).
The Rorschach test is appropriate for subjects from the age of five to adulthood.
It has been suggested that Rorschach's use of inkblots may have been inspired by German doctor Justinus Kerner who, in 1857, had published a popular book of poems, each of which was inspired by an accidental inkblot.
'''Card V''' is an easily elaborated card that is not usually perceived as threatening, and typically instigates a "change of pace" in the test, after the previous more challenging cards.
Being the last card, it may provide an opportunity for the subject to "sign out" by indicating what they feel their situation is like, or what they desire to know.
To note, the authors did not create new variables or indices to be coded, but systematically reviewed variables that had been used in past systems.
In the 1960s, the Rorschach was the most widely used projective test.
Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning.
Exner has published detailed instructions, but Wood et al.
A score of W is typically associated with the subject's motivation to interact with his or her surrounding environment.
In a national survey in the U.S., the Rorschach was ranked eighth among psychological tests used in outpatient mental health facilities.
Responses coded S indicate an oppositional or uncooperative test subject.
These experiments showed that the testers' prejudices could result in them "seeing" non-existent relationships in the data.
The goal in coding content of the Rorschach is to categorize the objects that the subject describes in response to the inkblot.
as well as by any comments the subject may make in addition to providing a direct response.
Analysis of responses is recorded by the test administrator using a tabulation and scoring sheet and, if required, a separate location chart.
The Chapmans ran an experiment with fake Rorschach responses in which these valid signs were always associated with homosexuality.
In the vast majority of cases, anyway, the Rorschach test wasn't singled out but used as one of several in a battery of tests, and despite the criticism of usage of the Rorschach in the courts, out of 8,000 cases in which forensic psychologists used Rorschach-based testimony, the appropriateness of the instrument was challenged only six times, and the testimony was ruled inadmissible in only one of those cases.
It has been reported that popular responses on the first card include bat, badge and coat of arms.
The R-PAS manual is intended to be a comprehensive tool for administering, scoring, and interpreting the Rorschach.
Finally, symmetry makes possible the interpretation of whole scenes.
Having difficulty with processing this card may indicate trouble dealing with unstructured data, but aside from this there are few particular "pulls" typical of this card.
