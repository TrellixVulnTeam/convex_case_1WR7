At least one resident believes that the graves unique in the region because many are not oriented toward Mecca, and therefore must pre-date Islam.
Urban cemeteries developed over time into a more landscaped form as part of civic development of beliefs and institutions that sought to portray the city as civilized and harmonious.
More recent is the practice of families with large estates choosing to create private cemeteries in the form of burial sites, monuments, crypts, or mausoleums on their property; the mausoleum at Fallingwater is an example of this practice.
''Columbarium walls'' are a common feature of many cemeteries, reflecting the increasing use of cremation rather than burial.
In order to physically manage the space within the cemetery (to avoid burials in existing graves) and to record locations in the burial register, most cemeteries have some systematic layout of graves in rows, generally grouped into larger sections as required.
Receiving vaults and crypts often needed to be aired before entering, as decomposing corpses used up so much oxygen that even candles could not remain lit.
While some of these sites later grew into true cemeteries, many were forgotten after a family moved away or died out.
Cemeteries in the United States may be relocated if the land is required for other reasons.
Usually there is a legal requirement to maintain records regarding the burials (or interment of ashes) within a cemetery.
This shortfall in funds for maintenance results in three main options: charge much higher prices for new burials, obtain some other kind of public subsidy, or neglect maintenance.
The traditional grave candles are called ''znicz'' in Polish.
These cemeteries were often not sectarian, nor co-located with a house of worship.
Often the maintenance of grass must be done by more labour-intensive (and therefore expensive) methods.
The Metropolitan Burial Act of 1852 legislated for the establishment of the first national system of government funded municipal cemeteries across the country, opening the way for a massive expansion of burial facilities throughout the late 19th century.
The older term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but primarily referred to a burial ground within a churchyard.
Placing burning grave candles on the cemetery to commemorate dead is a very common tradition in Poland.
In some cases, it is possible to squeeze a piece of wire or string under the plaque allowing a flower or small posy to be placed on the plaque itself or clips are glued onto the plaque for that purpose.
Cemetery authorities have to try to deal with such situations sensitively, as strong emotions are involved.
Where a number of family members are buried together (either vertically or horizontally), the slab or boundaries may encompass a number of graves.
Therefore, many cemeteries now provide walls (typically of brick or rendered brick construction) with a rectangular array of niches, with each niche being big enough to accommodate a person's cremated remains.
Legislative action was slow in coming, but in 1832 Parliament finally acknowledged the need for the establishment of large municipal cemeteries and encouraged their construction outside London.
Burial of a body at a site may protect the location from redevelopment, with such estates often being placed in the care of a trust or foundation.
Across Baha, burial grounds have been constructed in different ways.
The Cross Bones is a burial ground for prostitutes in London, and the Neptune Memorial Reef is an underwater columbarium near Key Biscayne.
Newer designs of columbarium walls take this desire to leave flowers into account by incorporating a metal clip or loop beside each plaque, typically designed to hold a single flower stem or a small posy.
In this regard, older cemeteries designed at a time of relatively low-cost labour and limited automation tend to present the greatest difficulties for maintenance.
Cemetery authorities normally employ a full-time staff of caretakers to dig graves.
Another problem with lawn cemeteries involves grass over-growth over time: the grass can grow over and cover the plaque, to the distress of families who can no longer easily locate the grave.
Labour costs in particular have risen substantially and so finding low-cost maintenance methods (meaning low-labour maintenance methods) is increasingly important.
The Magnificent Seven, seven large cemeteries around London, were established in the following decade, starting with Kensal Green in 1832.
Selecting (or grading) the land intended for a lawn cemetery so that it is completely flat allows the use of large efficient mowers (such as ride-on mowers or lawn tractors) - the plaques (being horizontally set in the ground) lie below the level of the blades and are not damaged by the blades.
From about the 7th century, European burial was under the control of the Church and could only take place on consecrated church ground.
These objects often require manual intervention; in some cases objects will be picked up and returned after maintenance, in other cases (e.g.
The light rail transit line running to the south end eventually had to be built directly under the road.
In the Afro-Brazilian urban mythos (such as Umbanda), there is a character loosely related to cemeteries and its aura: the Zé Pilintra (in fact, Zé Pilintra is more related to bohemianism and night life than with cemeteries, where the reigning entity is ''Exu Caveira'' or ''Exu Cemitério'', similar to Voodoo Baron Samedi).
When land within a city could be found, the cemetery was enclosed with a wall to give it a garden-like quality.
All of these issues tend to put pressure on the re-use of grave sites within cemeteries.
As a consequence, natural burial may actually be less efficient land-use than a traditional cemetery.
A more recent trend, particularly in South American cities, involves constructing high-rise buildings to house graves.
These ''burial registers'' usually contain (at a minimum) the name of the person buried, the date of burial and the location of the burial plots within the cemetery, although some contain far more detail.
The bones of an estimated 6 million people are to be found there.
While cemetery authorities increasingly impose restrictions on the nature and type of objects that can be placed on lawn graves and actively remove prohibited items, grieving families are often unwilling to comply with these restrictions and become very upset if the items are removed.
More formal visits will often leave a poppy wreath.
Adolph Strauch introduced this style in 1855 in Cincinnati.
In Britain the movement was driven by dissenters and public health concerns.
Many cemeteries have areas based on different styles, reflecting the diversity of cultural practices around death and how it changes over time.
Some families hired a blacksmith and had large crosses made from various metals put on the place of burial.
Not all urban cemeteries engaged in re-use of graves, and cultural taboos often prevented it.
Each grave is marked with a commemorative plaque (around 30&nbsp;cm x 20&nbsp;cm is typical) placed horizontally at the head of the grave at ground-level.
The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an "above-ground grave" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice.
A small plaque (about 15&nbsp;cm x 10&nbsp;cm) can be affixed across the front of each niche and is generally included as part of the price of a niche.
As in  a lawn cemetery, grass grows over the graves themselves.
A large action of this type occurred in 18th century Paris when human remains were transferred from graveyards all over the city to the Catacombs of Paris.
Re-use then only occurs where there are no objections allowing the "forgotten" graves to be re-used.
As with lawn cemeteries, the original expectation was that people would prefer the uncluttered simplicity of a wall of plaques, but the practice of leaving flowers is very entrenched.
In principle it would seem easier to re-use such grave sites as there can be no claims of desecration, but often this is made more complicated by the legal rights to be buried obtained by the pre-purchase, as any limited tenure clause only takes effect after there has been a burial.
Typically, lawn cemeteries comprise a number of graves in this lawn setting with trees and gardens on the perimeter.
This practice is seen in the closing scene of the film ''Schindler's List'', although in that case it is not on a Jewish grave.
As with graves, the niches may be assigned by the cemetery authorities or families may choose from the unoccupied niches available.
Those who could not pay for a headstone at all usually had some religious symbol made from wood on the place of burial such as a Christian cross; however, this would quickly deteriorate under the rain or snow.
These will often have messages written on the cross.
Practices varied, but in continental Europe, bodies were usually buried in a mass grave until they had decomposed.
The employment of skilled personnel for the preparation of graves is done not only to ensure the grave is dug in the correct location and at the correct depth, but also to relieve families from having to dig the grave for a recently dead relative, and as a matter of public safety, in order to prevent inexperienced visitors from injuring themselves, to ensure unused graves are properly covered, and to avoid legal liability that would result from an injury related to an improperly dug or uncovered grave.
Concerns were also raised about the potential public health hazard arising from the inhalation of gases generated from human putrefaction under the then prevailing miasma theory of disease.
Mourners who could afford the work of a stonemason had a headstone engraved with a name, dates of birth and death and sometimes other biographical data, and set up over the place of burial.
Corpses were usually buried wrapped in cloth, since coffins, burial vaults, and above-ground crypts inhibited the process of decomposition.
In the United Kingdom the minimum depth from the surface to the highest lid is 36&nbsp;inches.
People with family buried in local cemeteries are usually quite concerned about neglect of cemetery maintenance and will usually argue in favour of public subsidy of local cemetery maintenance, whereas other people without connection to the area often argue that public spending comes from their taxes and therefore should be spent on the living in the district rather than being wasted on the dead.
Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding a large number of bodies at a time.
Often the entire grave is covered by a slab, commonly concrete, but it can be more expensive materials such as marble or granite, and/or has its boundaries delimited by a fence which may be made of concrete, cast iron or timber.
The areas between the beams are wide enough to permit easy mowing with a larger mower.
One pragmatic strategy is to publicly announce plans to re-use older graves and invite families to respond if they are willing or not.
In some cases, cemeteries rose  above the level of the surrounding streets, and heavy retaining walls were built to keep the cemetery (and corpses) from falling into the street.
Presently, state regulations have made it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to start private cemeteries; many require a plan to care for the site in perpetuity.
As historic cemeteries begin to reach their capacity for full burials, alternative memorialization, such as collective memorials for cremated individuals, is becoming more common.
(Cemetery c)" and specifies that the term "...originally applied to the Roman underground cemeteries or catacombs " Cemeteries are normally distinct from churchyards, which are typically consecrated according to one denomination and are attached directly to a single place of worship.
Although in principle natural burial can be performed in any style of cemetery, typically the environmental motivations of those requesting natural burial tend to favor the use of a natural bushland or woodland setting for the natural burial.
Wren's idea was not immediately accepted.
Often the cemetery displays this information in the form of a map, which is used both by the cemetery administration in managing their land use and also by friends and family members seeking to locate a particular grave within the cemetery.
This could include the opening of cemeteries by private or joint stock companies.
The word ''cemetery'' (from Greek ''κοιμητήριον'', "sleeping place") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground.
Monumental cemeteries are often regarded as unsightly due to the random collection of monuments and headstones they contain.
So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area.
New cemeteries are generally established on the periphery of towns and cities, where large tracts of land are still available.
It is usually possible to purchase (or pay a deposit) to reserve the use of adjacent niches for other family members.
a large public park or ground laid out expressly for the internment of the dead, and not being the ‘yard’ of any church.
As a reaction to this, the first "garden" cemetery—Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris—opened in 1804.
However, as well as their own maintenance problems with such "shrines", families with graves in the surrounding area often complain to cemetery authorities about the "mess", as they believe it detracts from the dignity of their family's graves.
Therefore, the cemetery authorities must find a solution that satisfies both parties.
The construction and maintenance of headstones and other grave monuments are usually the responsibilities of surviving families and friends.
In the past, some Arab winters lasted for more than six months and would be accompanied with lots of rain and fog, which made movement difficult.
For cemeteries without space for new burials, the options are even more limited.
Nonetheless, urban cemeteries which were heavily used were often very unhealthy.
In Europe this was often accompanied with a depiction of their coat of arms.
The re-use of graves allowed for a steady stream of income, which enabled the cemetery to remain well-maintained and in good repair.
This is considered a valid method of resource management and provides income to keep older cemeteries viable, thus forestalling the need for permanent closure, which would result in a reduction of their work force.
Subsequently, garden/rural cemeteries often feature above-ground monuments and memorials, mausoleums, and columbaria.
The same bill also closed all inner London churchyards to new deposits.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a cemetery as a "burial-ground generally; now esp.
The Rosary Cemetery in Norwich was opened in 1819 as a burial ground for all religious backgrounds.
The cost of building a garden/rural cemetery often meant that only the wealthy could afford burial there.
On the other hand, cemetery authorities are well aware that many old graves are forgotten and not visited and that their re-use will not cause distress to anyone.
Urban planner and author John Claudius Loudon was one of the first professional cemetery designers, and his book ''On the Laying Out, Planting and Managing of Cemeteries'' (1843) was very influential on designers and architects of the period.
Urban cemeteries were more sanitary (a place to safely dispose of decomposing corpses) than they were aesthetically pleasing.
The sheer stench from decomposing corpses, even when buried deeply, was over overpowering in areas adjacent to the urban cemetery.
Sometimes, several families would arrange to bury their dead together.
'People used to die in large numbers and very rapidly one after the other because of diseases.
Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with text, drawings, and patterns.
Again, although cemetery authorities try to prohibit the quantity and nature of objects placed on graves (a common restriction is to allow only fresh flowers, not in a vase or pot), but mourning families might ignore any such regulations and become very upset if other objects are removed.
The issue became particularly acute after the cholera epidemic of 1831, which killed 52,000 people in Britain alone, putting unprecedented pressure on the country's burial capacity.
Another issue relates to limited amount of land.
However, if the cemetery is not relocated, descendants of people buried there may visit the cemetery.
Another consequence of the lack of orderly burials is the need for highly accurate surveying of the grave site for effective cemetery management, to prevent the accidental re-use of a grave site.
As late 20th century suburban sprawl pressured the pace of development in formerly rural areas, it became increasingly common for larger exurban properties to be encumbered by "religious easements," which are legal requirements for the property owner to permit periodic maintenance of small burial plots located on the property but technically not owned with it.
Also re-use of a used grave involves the removal of any monuments and headstones, which may cause further distress to families (although families will typically be allowed to take away the monuments and headstones if they wish).
For cemetery authorities, monumental cemeteries are difficult to maintain.
Burial registers are an important resource for genealogy.
Decay and damage through vandalism or cemetery maintenance practices can render monuments and headstones either unsafe or at least unsightly.
For instance, many cemeteries in the southeastern United States were relocated by the Tennessee Valley Authority from areas about to be flooded by dam construction.
There are a number of different styles of cemetery in use.
Although the authorities might declare that the grave is sufficiently old that there will be no human remains still present, nonetheless many people regard the re-use of graves (particularly their family's graves) as a desecration.
Different cultures have different attitudes to destruction of cemeteries and use of the land for construction.
The shift to municipal cemeteries or those established by private companies was usually accompanied by the establishing of landscaped burial grounds outside the city (e.g.
Multiple burials is a consequence of the limited size of the urban cemetery, which cannot easily expand due to adjacent building development.
As the writing on the plaques has to be fairly small to fit on the small size of the plaque, the design of columbarium walls is constrained by the ability of visitors to read the plaques.
Traditionally cemetery management only involves the allocation of land for burial, the digging and filling of graves, and the maintenance of the grounds and landscaping.
Urnfield culture of the European Bronze Age.
In many cases, after a suitable period of time has elapsed, the headstones are removed and the now former cemetery is converted to a recreational park or construction site.
While cremated remains can be kept at home by families in urns or scattered in some significant or attractive place, neither of these approaches allows for a long-lasting commemorative plaque to honour the dead nor provide a place for the wider circle of friends and family to come to mourn or visit.
Natural burials are motivated by a desire to be environmentally conscious with the body rapidly decomposing and becoming part of the natural environment without incurring the environmental cost of traditional burials.
Jewish war graves are sometimes marked by a timber Star of David.
The Arlington National Cemetery, one of the United States' largest military cemeteries, has a registry, ''The ANC Explorer'', which contains details such as photographs of the front and back of the tombstones.
However, as with other types of cemetery, the intentions of the cemetery authorities may be in conflict with the grieving practices of family and friends, for whom being able to visit the precise location of a grave and read the headstone is often important.
The use of adjacent niches (vertically or horizontally) usually permits a larger plaque spanning all the niches involved, which provides more space for the writing.
Garden/rural cemeteries were not necessarily outside city limits.
However, because of the rapid decomposition of a natural burial, in principle the re-use of the grave site can occur earlier than in other conventional burials, which would improve the efficiency of land use.
Mourners leave flowers (and other objects) on top of columbarium walls or at the base, as close as they can to the plaque of their family member.
However, it remains to be seen if family members will accept the early re-use of natural burial sites, given the general community dislike of re-use of any kind of grave.
These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs.
As the flowers decay, they simply fall to the ground and do not create a significant maintenance problem.
If a municipal or religious cemetery had not been established, settlers would seek out a small plot of land, often in wooded areas bordering their fields, to begin a family plot.
There are prayers said at the gravesite, and the stone is left on the visitor's departure.
The bones were then exhumed and stored in ossuaries, either along the arcaded bounding walls of the cemetery, or within the church under floor slabs and behind walls.
Public attitudes towards subsidies are highly variable.
Up on the beam, the plaques cannot be easily overgrown by grass, and spaces between the plaques permit families to place flowers and other objects out of reach of the mowing.
Traditionally a single payment is made at the time of burial, but the cemetery authority incurs expenses in cemetery maintenance over many decades.
Sometimes the cemetery authorities request a further payment to avoid re-use of a grave, but often this backfires politically.
Often, cemeteries are relocated to accommodate building.
small toys on children's graves) re-introduces some clutter to the cemetery and makes it difficult to use the larger mowers.
It was not uncommon in some places, such as England, for fresher corpses to be chopped up to aid decomposition, and for bones to be burned to create fertilizer.
In some natural cemeteries, names can be inscribed on naturally-shaped rocks (not carved headstones) but, unless the rock is particularly large and heavy, it can easily be knocked or kicked to another nearby location.
The concept quickly spread across Europe.
Cemeteries may also be moved so that the land can be reused for transportation structures, public buildings, or even private development.
The excessive filling of rural/garden cemeteries with elaborate above-ground memorials, many of dubious artistic quality or taste, created a backlash which led to the development of the lawn cemetery.
As with most other human property such as houses and means of transport, richer families used to compete for the artistic value of their family headstone in comparison to others around it, sometimes adding a statue (such as a weeping angel) on the top of the grave.
An early example of a landscape-style cemetery is Père Lachaise in Paris.
However, there may be some older graves in a cemetery for whom there are local and vocal descendants who will mount a public campaign against re-use.
Decomposition of the human body releases significant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses which can cause disease and illness, and many urban cemeteries were located without consideration for local groundwater.
Because of the number of trees usually present in a natural cemetery, burials occur in whatever location and orientation best fits the natural environment as opposed to the more traditional rows or other orderly arrangements in traditional cemeteries.
There must be 6&nbsp;inches between each coffin, which on average is 15&nbsp;inches high.
Today, it is not unheard of to discover groupings of tombstones, ranging from a few to a dozen or more, on undeveloped land.
While uncommon today, family (or private) cemeteries were a matter of practicality during the settlement of America.
Before 1977, double graves were dug to 8 feet and singles to 6 feet.
dead flowers) they will be disposed of.
War graves will commonly have small timber crosses left with a red poppy attached to its centre.
In particular, in an era in which the death of children is now relatively uncommon, some parents create quite large shrines at their child's grave, decorating them with toys, wind chimes, statues of angels and cherubs, etc.
Low (10–15&nbsp;cm) raised concrete slabs (beams) are placed across the cemetery.
Flowers are fleeting; the symbology inherent in the use of a stone is to show that the love, honor, memories, and soul of the loved one are eternal.
Visitors to loved ones interred in Jewish cemeteries often leave a small stone on the top of the headstone.
As the mower blades are set lower than the top of the beam and the mowers do not go over the beam, the blades cannot damage the plaques.
The re-use of graves already used for burial can cause considerable upset to family members.
Early urban cemeteries were churchyards, which filled quickly and exhibited a haphazard placement of burial markers as sextons tried to squeeze new burials into the remaining space.
Grasses that propagate by a below-ground rhizome tend not to cover the plaque as easily.
Coffins and burial equipment can also release significant amounts of toxic chemicals such as arsenic (used to preserve coffin wood) and formaldehyde (used in varnishes and as a sealant) and toxic metals such as copper, lead, and zinc (from coffin handles and flanges).
That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about...
Also, even when cemeteries have a limited tenure provision in place, often funding shortages force them to contemplate re-use earlier than the original arrangements provided for.
Modern burials in urban cemeteries also release toxic chemicals associated with embalming, such as arsenic, formaldehyde, and mercury.
Urban cemeteries relied heavily on the fact that the soft parts of the body would decompose in about 25 years (although, in moist soil, decomposition can take up to 70 years).
It was conceived in 1711 by the British architect Sir Christopher Wren, who advocated the creation of landscaped burial grounds which featured well-planned walkways which gave extensive access to graves and planned plantings of trees, bushes, and flowers.
Private cemeteries are nearly always forbidden on incorporated residential zones.
Another type of grave site that must be considered for re-use are those that have never been used (but have been purchased at some time for future use).
Many people will bury a beloved pet on the family property.
Cemeteries usually dispose of these flowers after a few weeks in order to keep the space maintained.
However, increasingly, many people regard the resultant collection of individual headstones, concrete slabs and fences (some of which may be decayed or damaged) to be aesthetically unappealing, leading to new cemetery developments either standardising the shape or design of headstones or plaques, sometimes by providing a standard shaped marker as part of the service provided by the cemetery.
In some cases, skeletons were exhumed from graveyards and moved into ossuaries or catacombs.
In keeping with the intention of "returning to nature" and the early re-use potential, natural cemeteries do not normally have conventional grave markings such as headstones.
Therefore, communication about re-use in local cemeteries tends to occur only through in local publications, which often do not reach family members living further afield who may only become aware of the re-use of the grave after the event (and after the removal and destruction of monuments and headstones).
Loudon himself, designed three cemeteries - Bath Abbey Cemetery, Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge, and Southampton Old Cemetery.
However, as discussed above, the use of large mowers and string trimmers might be efficient but often cannot be used in cemeteries because they physically are too large to fit between graves or because they can damage the monuments and headstones.
A ''natural cemetery'' or ''eco-cemetery'' or ''green cemetery'' is a new style of cemetery and is an area set aside for natural burials (with or without coffins).
If the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them.
Preparation of the grave is usually done before the mourners arrive for the burial.
The first garden/rural cemetery in the United States was Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, founded by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1831.
Many urban cemeteries are characterized by multiple burials in the same grave.
But by the early 1800s, existing churchyards were growing overcrowded and unhealthy, with graves stacked upon each other or emptied and reused for new burials.
Most of the Saudis in Al Baha are  Muslims, and this is reflected in their cemetery and funeral customs.
On the other hand, newer cemeteries might be designed to be more efficiently maintained with lower labour through the increased use of equipment, e.g.
Similar private non-denominational cemeteries were established near industrialising towns with growing populations, such as Manchester (1821) and Liverpool (1825).
This has caused significant problems in the provision of transportation services to the southern half of the City of Calgary, as the main southbound road connecting the south end of the city with downtown threads through a series of cemeteries founded in the 1930s.
In some countries it is considered normal to destroy the graves, while in others the graves are traditionally respected for a century or more.
