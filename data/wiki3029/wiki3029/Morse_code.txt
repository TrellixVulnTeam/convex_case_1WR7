While voice and data transmissions are limited to specific amateur radio bands under U.S. rules, Morse code is permitted on all amateur bands—LF, MF, HF, VHF, and UHF.
The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was difficult to use, there had been some earlier attempts.
In the U.S., pilots do not actually have to know Morse to identify the transmitter because the dot/dash sequence is written out next to the transmitter's symbol on aeronautical charts.
Prosigns for Morse code are special (usually) unwritten procedural signals or symbols that are used to indicate changes in communications protocol status or white space text formatting actions.
ATIS (Automatic Transmitter Identification System) uses Morse code to identify uplink sources of analog satellite transmissions.
Submarine periscopes include a signal lamp.
In 1910 the US Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane.
In some countries, certain portions of the amateur radio bands are reserved for transmission of Morse code signals only.
It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory.
Radiotelegraphy was also extensively used by warplanes, especially by long-range patrol planes that were sent out by those navies to scout for enemy warships, cargo ships, and troop ships.
# medium gap (between words) : 0000000
That introduces ambiguity because words have different numbers of characters, and characters have different dot lengths.
The word per minute rate would be close to the PARIS standard, and the code groups per minute would be close to the CODEX standard.
The text speed is how fast the entire message is sent.
For new applicants it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory, as well as 16 WPM code and 20 WPM text tests.
International contests in code copying are still occasionally held.
For each class of license, the code group speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement.
Morse code can also be translated by computer and used in a speaking communication aid.
In the United States the final commercial Morse code transmission was on July 12, 1999, signing off with Samuel Morse's original 1844 message, "What hath God wrought", and the prosign "SK".
In addition, rapidly moving armies in the field could not have fought effectively without radiotelegraphy, because they moved more rapidly than telegraph and telephone lines could be erected.
Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence, equal to the dot duration.
The shorter marks were called "dots", and the longer ones "dashes", and the letters most commonly used were assigned the shorter sequences of dots and dashes.
SOS is not three separate characters, rather, it is a prosign SOS, and is keyed without gaps between characters.
Also, Certificates of Code Proficiency are issued by several amateur radio societies, including the American Radio Relay League.
On the other hand, when the first airplane flight was made from California to Australia in the 1930s on the ''Southern Cross'', one of its four crewmen was its radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.
In some countries, during periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code ('''—&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;—''') or the code may be removed, which tells pilots and navigators that the station is unreliable.
Another popular teaching method is the '''Koch method''', named after German psychologist Ludwig Koch, which uses the full target speed from the outset, but begins with just two characters.
The character speed is how fast each individual letter is sent.
In some cases this means alternately blowing into and sucking on a plastic tube ("sip-and-puff" interface).
Each one was quickly broken by Allied SIGINT, and standard Morse was restored by Spring 1916.
There is little point in learning to read ''written'' Morse as above; rather, the ''sounds'' of all of the letters and symbols need to be learned, for both sending and receiving.
Some mine rescues have used pulling on a rope - a short pull for a dot and a long pull for a dash.
Until 2003 the International Telecommunication Union mandated Morse code proficiency as part of the amateur radio licensing procedure worldwide.
Usually, speeds are stated in words per minute.
It is not immediately clear how a specific word rate determines the dot duration in milliseconds.
In one case reported in the radio amateur magazine ''QST'', an old shipboard radio operator who had a stroke and lost the ability to speak or write could communicate with his physician (a radio amateur) by blinking his eyes in Morse.
The Morse code was developed so that operators could translate the indentations marked on the paper tape into text messages.
However the Federal Communications Commission still grants commercial radiotelegraph operator licenses to applicants who pass its code and written tests.
Historians have called it the first digital code.
This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship.
The original amateur radio operators used Morse code exclusively, since voice-capable radio transmitters did not become commonly available until around 1920.
Because Morse code is usually sent by hand, it is unlikely that an operator could be that precise with the dot length, and the individual characteristics and preferences of the operators usually override the standards.
Once he and the ''Spirit of St. Louis'' were off the ground, Lindbergh was truly alone and incommunicado.
High-speed telegraphy contests are held; according to the Guinness Book of Records in June 2005 at the International Amateur Radio Union's 6th World Championship in High Speed Telegraphy in Primorsko, Bulgaria, Andrei Bindasov of Belarus transmitted 230 morse code marks of mixed text in one minute.
That same year a radio on the airship ''America'' had been instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew.
In these two cases interpreters were available to understand those series of eye-blinks.
Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting during World War I, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation.
Some Nokia mobile phones offer an option to alert the user of an incoming text message with the Morse tone "'''·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;—&nbsp;—&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·'''" (representing SMS or Short Message Service).
Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, as long as they have some minimal motor control.
It is common to assume that a word is 5 characters long.
This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license.
Beginning in 1836, the American artist Samuel F. B. Morse, the American physicist Joseph Henry, and Alfred Vail developed an electrical telegraph system.
# short gap (between letters) : 000
Warships, including those of the U.S. Navy, have long used signal lamps to exchange messages in Morse code.
A difference between amateur radio licenses and commercial radiotelegraph licenses is that commercial operators must be able to receive code groups of random characters along with plain language text.
Russian requires 1 extra character, "Ы" , which is encoded with 5 elements.
Similarly, a few US Museum ship stations are operated by Morse enthusiasts.
For example, for the Radiotelegraph Operator License, the examinee must pass a 20 word per minute plain text test and a 16 word per minute code group test.
In 1841, Cooke and Wheatstone built a telegraph that printed the letters from a wheel of typefaces struck by a hammer.
This is called their "fist", and experienced operators can recognize specific individuals by it alone.
If, for example, the operator wanted a character speed of 13 words per minute, the operator would choose a dot rate that would send the typical word 13 times in exactly one minute.
Modern use continues, in part, as a way to communicate while maintaining radio silence.
Morse code was used as an international standard for maritime distress until 1999, when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress Safety System.
Some methods of teaching Morse code use a dichotomic search table.
Other forms of 'Fractional Morse' or 'Fractionated Morse' have emerged.
Decoding software for Morse code ranges from software-defined wide-band radio receivers coupled to the Reverse Beacon Network, which decodes signals and detects CQ messages on ham bands, to smartphone applications.
The Commission specifies Morse code test elements at 16 code groups per minute, 20 words per minute, 20 code groups per minute, and 25 words per minute.
In addition to knowing, understanding, and being able to copy the standard written alpha-numeric and punctuation characters or symbols at high speeds, skilled high speed operators must also be fully knowledgeable of all of the special unwritten Morse code symbols for the standard Prosigns for Morse code and the meanings of these special procedural signals in standard Morse code communications protocol.
"PARIS" and "CODEX" are two such standard words.
A well-known Morse code rhythm from the Second World War period derives from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, the opening phrase of which was regularly played at the beginning of BBC broadcasts.
:''T'' = 1200 / ''W''
Their basic award starts at 10 wpm with endorsements as high as 40 wpm, and are available to anyone who can copy the transmitted text.
For example, CQ is broadcast to be interpreted as "seek you" (I'd like to converse with anyone who can hear my signal).
A code was needed to transmit natural language using only these pulses, and the silence between them.
A good operator who sends clearly and is easy to copy is said to have a "good fist".
Using the word CODEX with 60 dot units, the dot length at 20 words per minute is 50 milliseconds.
To accurately compare code copying speed records of different eras it is useful to keep in mind that different standard words (50 dot durations versus 60 dot durations) and different interword gaps (5 dot durations versus 7 dot durations) may have been used when determining such speed records.
Where: ''T'' is the unit time, or dot duration in milliseconds, and ''W'' is the speed in wpm.
In the aviation service Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute.
To reflect the sounds of Morse code receivers, the operators began to vocalize a dot as "dit", and a dash as "dah".
Gerke changed nearly half of the alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code.
For this reason, a standard word is helpful to measure operator transmission speed.
SKATS maps hangul characters to arbitrary letters of the Latin script and has no relationship to pronunciation in Korean.
A simple way to do this is to choose a dot duration that would send a typical word the desired number of times in one minute.
Today among amateur operators there are several organizations that recognize high speed code ability, one group consisting of those who can copy Morse at 60 wpm.
a flashing light) using devices like an Aldis lamp or a heliograph, a common flashlight, or even a car horn.
For Russian and Bulgarian, Russian Morse code is used to map the Cyrillic characters to four-element codes.
In the original Morse telegraphs, the receiver's armature made a clicking noise as it moved in and out of position to mark the paper tape.
Aeronautical charts show the identifier of each navigational aid next to its location on the map.
In July 1939 at a contest in Asheville, North Carolina in the United States Ted R. McElroy set a still-standing record for Morse copying, 75.2 wpm.
The use of abbreviations for common terms permits conversation even when the operators speak different languages.
Software is also frequently employed to produce and decode Morse code radio signals.
Thus the most common letter in English, the letter "E", has the shortest code, a single dot.
The narrow signal bandwidth also takes advantage of the natural aural selectivity of the human brain, further enhancing weak signal readability.
# short mark, dot or "dit" (·) : 1
For example, speeds run with the CODEX standard word and the PARIS standard may differ by up to 20%.
This system sent pulses of electric current along wires which controlled an electromagnet that was located at the receiving end of the telegraph system.
Morse code may be represented as a binary code, and that is what telegraph operators do when transmitting messages.
Some modern navigation receivers automatically translate the code into displayed letters.
Once strings containing those two characters can be copied with 90% accuracy, an additional character is added, and so on until the full character set is mastered.
While the Federal Communications Commission no longer requires Morse code for amateur radio licenses, the old requirements were similar to the requirements for commercial radiotelegraph licenses.
Specifying the dot duration is, however, not the common practice.
When the current was interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus, and that portion of the moving tape remained unmarked.
It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.
Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding.
After some minor changes, International Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris, and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Based upon a 50 dot duration standard word such as PARIS, the time for one dot duration or one unit can be computed by the formula:
In Canada, the identification is removed entirely to signify the navigation aid is not to be used.
This efficiency makes CW extremely useful for DX (distance) transmissions, as well as for low-power transmissions (commonly called "QRP operation", from the Q-code for "reduce power").
For example, the VOR based at Manchester Airport in England is abbreviated as "MCT", and MCT in Morse code is transmitted on its  radio frequency.
For Chinese, Chinese telegraph code is used to map Chinese characters to four-digit codes and send these digits out using standard Morse code.
An important advantage of Morse code over row column scanning is that, once learned, it does not require looking at a display.
William Pierpont N0HFF also notes that some operators may have passed 100 wpm.
Morse code speed is measured in words per minute (wpm) or characters per minute (cpm).
Morse code is usually heard at the receiver as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000&nbsp;Hz), so transmissions are easier to copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, and it can be used in very high noise / low signal environments.
Sometimes, especially while teaching Morse code, the timing rules above are changed so two different speeds are used: a character speed and a text speed.
The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test.
Station identification letters are shown on air navigation charts.
'''Morse code''' is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment.
Members of the Boy Scouts of America may put a Morse interpreter's strip on their uniforms if they meet the standards for translating code at 5 wpm.
The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies.
The ARRL has a readability standard for robot encoders called ARRL Farnsworth Spacing  that is supposed to have higher readability for both robot and human decoders.
In addition, applications are now available for mobile phones that enable short messages to be input in Morse Code.
The Modern International Morse code, or ''continental code'', was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany.
#medium gap (between words) : seven time units long
Morse messages are generally transmitted by a hand-operated device such as a telegraph key, so there are variations introduced by the skill of the sender and receiver — more experienced operators can send and receive at faster speeds.
An original solution to the problem that caretakers have to learn to decode has been an electronic typewriter with the codes written on the keys.
Licensees have reactivated the old California coastal Morse station KPH and regularly transmit from the site under either this Call sign or as KSM.
Aeronautical navigational aids, such as VORs and NDBs, constantly identify in Morse code.
Characters have differing lengths because they contain differing numbers of dots and dashes.
In popular culture, this is mostly remembered in the book ''The Codebreakers'' by Kahn and in the national archives of the UK and Australia (whose SIGINT operators copied most of this Morse variant).
Some method to standardize the transformation of a word rate to a dot duration is useful.
As of 2015 the United States Air Force still trains ten people a year in Morse.
Many countries subsequently removed the Morse requirement from their licence requirements.
people who are also deaf or blind) can receive Morse through a skin buzzer.
In North America, many thousands of individuals have increased their code recognition speed (after initial memorization of the characters) by listening to the regularly scheduled code practice transmissions broadcast by W1AW, the American Radio Relay League's headquarters station.
# longer mark, dash or "dah" (–) : 111
The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot.
Dots which are not the final element of a character became vocalized as "di".
Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a paper tape.
PARIS mimics a word rate that is typical of natural language words and reflects the benefits of Morse code's shorter code durations for common characters such as "e" and "t".
Using the word PARIS as a standard, the number of dot units is 50 and a simple calculation shows that the dot length at 20 words per minute is 60 milliseconds.
By this time they are "hearing" phrases and sentences rather than words.
Through May 2013 the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests based upon the CODEX standard word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission.
Although the traditional telegraph key (straight key) is still used by some amateurs, the use of mechanical semi-automatic keyers (known as "bugs") and of fully automatic electronic keyers is prevalent today.
Operators skilled in Morse code can often understand ("copy") code in their heads at rates in excess of 40 wpm.
Morse code can be transmitted in a number of ways: originally as electrical pulses along a telegraph wire, but also as an audio tone, a radio signal with short and long tones, or as a mechanical, audible or visual signal (e.g.
On the other hand, the three Americans' system for telegraphy, which was first used in about 1844, was designed to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents were received.
Radio navigation aids such as VORs and NDBs for aeronautical use broadcast identifying information in the form of Morse Code, though many VOR stations now also provide voice identification.
Morse code is transmitted using just two states (on and off).
The Farnsworth method is named for Donald R. "Russ" Farnsworth, also known by his call sign, W6TTB.
In his earliest code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals, and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been sent.
When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses.
In aviation, instrument pilots use radio navigation aids.
When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving paper tape, making an indentation on the tape.
Codes were sung by users; see the voice typewriter employing morse or votem, Newell and Nabarro, 1968.
Kahn's cited sources come from the popular press and wireless magazines of the time.
A "poor fist" is a characteristic of sloppy or hard to copy Morse code.
The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.
People learning Morse code using the '''Farnsworth method''' are taught to send and receive letters and other symbols at their full target speed, that is with normal relative timing of the dots, dashes and spaces within each symbol for that speed.
This is our last cry before our eternal silence."
The United States Coast Guard has ceased all use of Morse code on the radio, and no longer monitors any radio frequencies for Morse code transmissions, including the international medium frequency (MF) distress frequency of 500 kHz.
Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character (letter or numeral) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.
OM (old man), YL (young lady) and XYL ("ex-YL" – wife) are common abbreviations.
During early World War I (1914–1916) Germany briefly experimented with 'dotty' and 'dashy' Morse, in essence adding a dot or a dash at the end of each Morse symbol.
# intra-character gap (between the dots and dashes within a character) : 0
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed international communication used Morse code on telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits.
An important application is signalling for help through SOS, "'''·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;—&nbsp;—&nbsp;—&nbsp;·&nbsp;·&nbsp;·'''".
In an emergency, Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily "keyed" on and off, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication.
What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse.
Working from the above ITU definition and further defining a bit as a dot time, a Morse code sequence may be made from a combination of the following five bit strings:
(By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.)
These include prosigns, Q codes, and a set of Morse code abbreviations for typical message components.
Radio telegraphy using Morse code was vital during World War II, especially in carrying messages between the warships and the naval bases of the belligerents.
The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission.
The timing of the notes corresponds to the Morse for "V"; di-di-di-dah and stood for "V for Victory" (as well as the Roman numeral for the number five).
YL or OM is used by an operator when referring to the other operator, XYL or OM is used by an operator when referring to his or her spouse.
In addition, individual operators differ slightly, for example using slightly longer or shorter dashes or gaps, perhaps only for particular characters.
Morse code has been in use for more than 160 years&mdash;longer than any other electrical coding system.
The relatively limited speed at which Morse code can be sent led to the development of an extensive number of abbreviations to speed communication.
Also, it appears faster than scanning.
In aviation, Morse code in radio systems started to be used on a regular basis in the 1920s.
CODEX offers a word rate that is typical of 5-letter code groups (sequences of random letters).
However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete.
Many of the characters are encoded the same way (A, O, E, I, T, M, N, R, K, etc.).
In 1837, William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in England  began using an electrical telegraph that also used electromagnets in its receivers.

Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators, although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing in most countries.
Morse code has been employed as an assistive technology, helping people with a variety of disabilities to communicate.
Beginning in the 1930s, both civilian and military pilots were required to be able to use Morse code, both for use with early communications systems and for identification of navigational beacons which transmitted continuous two- or three-letter identifiers in Morse code.
Consequently words also have different lengths in terms of dot duration, even when they contain the same number of characters.
Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of radiotelegraphy.
Bulgarian alphabet contains 30 characters, which exactly match all possible combinations of 1, 2, 3 and 4 dots and dashes.
Many amateur radio repeaters, for example, identify with Morse, even though they are used for voice communications.
This can be sent many ways: keying a radio on and off, flashing a mirror, toggling a flashlight and similar methods.
QTH is "location" ("My QTH" is "My location").
Another example occurred in 1966 when prisoner of war Jeremiah Denton, brought on television by his North Vietnamese captors, Morse-blinked the word ''TORTURE''.
There are two common typical words: "PARIS" and "CODEX".
Demonstration of this ability was still required for the privilege to use the HF bands.
