He evaluated 14 measurable and three reported factors that affect reading ease.
They found that reducing  from the 9th to the 6th-grade level increased readership 43% for an article on 'nylon'.
# Select several 100-word samples throughout the text.
A story 9 paragraphs long will lose three out of 10 readers by the 5th paragraph.
:Raw score ---           Final score
It also aids the reader in blending new information into existing knowledge structures.
In 1935, William S. Gray of the University of Chicago and Bernice Leary of Xavier College in Chicago published ''What Makes a Book Readable,'' one of the most important books in readability research.
Both Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning worked extensively with newspapers and the wire services in improving readability.
He wrote that word skills can be increased if the teacher introduces new words and repeats them often.
Starting with his own journal at the age of 13, Rubakin published many articles and books on science and many subjects for the great numbers of new readers throughout Russia.
The modified formula is:
:8.0–8.9 ---            Grades 11–12
They brought in a graded system to help students progress from simpler story lines to more advanced and abstract ones.
It represents the work of the race for thousands of years in perfecting an effective instrument of communication."
In 1948, he incorporated this list into a formula he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who later founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory.
While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.
This supports the fact that the average adult reads at the 9th-grade level.
The new formula correlated 0.70 with the McCall-Crabbs reading tests.
:Grade level= 0.4 * ( (average sentence length) + (percentage of Hard Words) )
In 1944, he founded the first readability consulting firm dedicated to reducing the "fog" in newspapers and business writing.
He found that an easier reading style helps to decide how much of an article is read.
They used three of these in their formula.
His work supported earlier research including the degree of reading ease for each kind of reading.
The oral sentence is clearest because it is the product of millions of daily efforts to be clear and strong.
Researchers have used various factors to measure readability, such as
* Image words, abstraction, direct and indirect statements, types of narration and sentences, phrases, and clauses.
Many textbooks on reading include pointers to readability.
* Easy enough for Army clerical personnel to use without special training or equipment.
Word skill was the best sign of intellectual development, and the strongest predictor of reading ease.
The FORCAST formula correlates 0.66 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.
There was a gain of 42,000 readers in a circulation of 275,000.
# Compute the average sentence length in words (divide the number of words by the number of sentences).
Writing experts have warned that if you "write to the formula," that is, attempt to simplify the text only by changing the length of the words and sentences, you may end up with text that is more difficult to read.
It was also the first to introduce the variable of interest to the concept of readability.
During the recession of the 1930s, the U.S. government invested in adult education.
Among the wire-service stories, the lower group got two-thirds more readers, and among local stories, 75 percent more readers.
On reading two newspapers and two magazines, he found that short sentence length and short word length were the best contributors to reading ease.
:Raw score = uncorrected reading grade of a student who can answer one-half of the test questions on a passage.
In 1921, Thorndike published ''Teachers Word Book'', which contained the frequencies of 10,000 words.
No man should talk worse than he writes, no man should write better than he should talk....
In 1921, Harry D. Kitson published ''The Mind of the Buyer'', one of the first books to apply psychology to marketing.
They found that three variables give the most reliable measure of text reading ease:
The Fry Graph correlates 0.86 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.
Of 29 factors that are significant for young readers, they found ten that are significant for adults.
He did not invent a formula, but a method for assessing the difficulty of materials for parent education.
Among the 17 significant measurable style variables, they selected five to create a formula:
They also increased the amount read in a given time, and made for easier acceptance.
In 1951, Farr, Jenkins, and Patterson simplified the formula further by changing the syllable count.
The test used a number of passages from newspapers, magazines, and books—as well as a standard reading test.
He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have.
They were concerned that junior high school science textbooks had so many technical words.
* Used vocabulary and sentence length in formulas to predict reading ease
* Reflex blink technique
It also shows that, for recreation, people read  texts that are two grades below their actual reading level.
:: ASW = average word length in syllables (number of syllables divided by number of words)
In 1981 the World Book Encyclopedia listed the grade levels of 44,000 words.
Many people in many languages have been helped by this.
It became one of the most popular formulas and easiest to apply.
Another variable was ''affixes''.
Writing for a class of readers other than one's own is very difficult.
Lyman Bryson of Teachers College, Columbia University found that many adults had poor reading ability due to poor education.
Lostutter argued for more readability testing in newspaper writing.
However, she found this was no better than word familiarity and sentence length in showing reading ease.
In 1952, he published ''The Technique of Clear Writing'' with his own Fog Index, a formula that correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.
It was a two-year study of adult reading interests.
By knowing a student's Lexile score, a teacher can find books that match his or her reading level.
Beginning in the 1970s, cognitive theorists began teaching that reading is really an act of thinking and organization.
In 1948, Bernard Feld did a study of every item and ad in the ''Birmingham News'' of 20 November 1947.
Bryson helped set up the Readability Laboratory at the College.
* Number of personal pronouns
*For reading alone below the 4th grade, the best learning gain requires at least 85% comprehension.
Third was format, followed closely by organization.
In 1939, Irving Lorge published an article that reported other combinations of variables that indicate difficulty more accurately than the ones Gray and Leary used.
At higher levels, ranking reading ease becomes more difficult, as individual difficulties become harder to identify.
It made it easier for teachers to choose books that matched class reading skills.
If simple language were easy, many of our problems would have been solved long ago."
* Fatigue in reading
The two publications with the largest circulations, ''TV Guide'' (13 million) and ''Readers Digest'' (12 million), are written at the 9th-grade level.
* Literature is a subject for statistical analysis.
The poorest readers, one-sixth of the adult population, need "simpler materials for use in promoting functioning literacy and in establishing fundamental reading habits."
*Book length can be a good measure of reading ease.
Readability can determine the ease with which humans can read computer program code, such as in embedded documentation.
He showed that even though these factors cannot be measured, they cannot be ignored.
The authors emphasized that one-half of the adult population at that time lacked suitable reading materials.
The writing experts all advise that, besides using a formula, observe all the norms of good writing, which are essential for writing readable texts.
This has led to better ways to assess reading ease.
While many writers and speakers since ancient times have used plain language, the 20th century brought more focus to reading ease.
The sample included 1,690 adults from a variety of settings and regions.
It dropped the use of affixes.
The SMOG formula correlates 0.88 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.
In the 1920s, the scientific movement in education looked for tests to measure students' achievement to aid in curriculum development.
A study by Charles Swanson in 1948 showed that better readability increases the total number of paragraphs read by 93% and the number of readers reading every paragraph by 82%.
A shorter story will lose only two.
:Where: Hard Words = words with more than two syllables.
In 1943, Rudolf Flesch published his PhD dissertation, ''Marks of a Readable Style'', which included a readability formula to predict the difficulty of adult reading material.
It had more to do with the convention and culture of the industry.
:4.9 and below ---    Grade 4 and below
*To help learning, the teacher should match book reading ease with reading skill.
In 1963, while teaching English teachers in Uganda, Edward Fry developed his Readability Graph.
They found that many readers lacked suitable reading materials: they would have liked to learn but the reading materials were too hard for them.
In 1973, a study commissioned by the US military of the reading skills required for different military jobs produced the FORCAST formula.
Research has shown that much money is wasted by companies in making texts hard for the average reader to read.
* Percentage of unique words
Bonnie Armbruster found that the most important feature for learning and comprehension is textual coherence, which comes in two types:
Armbruster confirmed Kintsch's finding that coherence and structure are more help for younger readers.
He also found that people will read less of long articles than of short ones.
The second part of the formula predicts human interest by using personal references and the number of personal sentences.
* Speed of perception
Flesch's work also made an enormous impact on journalism.
The formula satisfied requirements that it would be:
Mainly through their efforts in a few years, the readability of US newspapers went from the 16th to the 11th-grade level, where it remains today.
Manually, it took three hours to apply the formula to a book.
This was the last of the early formulas that used the Thorndike vocabulary-frequency list.
They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the “vocabulary burden” of textbooks.
In 1928, Carleton Washburne and Mabel Vogel created the first modern readability formula.
The original formula is:
::Where: nosw = number of one-syllable words per 100 words and
He found that the main blocks to comprehension are ''unfamiliar words'' and ''long sentences''.
In 1939, W.W. Patty and W. I Painter published a formula for measuring the vocabulary burden of textbooks.
Readability is different from legibility—which is a measure of how easily a reader can distinguish individual letters or characters from each other.
He also developed several new measures of cutoff scores.
In 1948, Flesch published his Reading Ease formula in two parts.
* Average sentence length
:Grade level = 20 &minus; (''N'' / 10)
# Compute the percentage of words NOT on the Dale–Chall word list of 3,000 easy words.
There are summaries of this research; see the links in this section.
Rather than using grade levels, it used a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 equivalent to the 12th grade and 100 equivalent to the 4th grade.
He found a 60% increase in readership for an article on 'corn'.
:PDW = Percentage of difficult words not on the Dale–Chall word list.
They wrote, "For them, the enriching values of reading are denied unless materials reflecting adult interests are adapted to their needs."
:10 and above ---      Grades  16 and above.
* Rate of work (reading speed)
* Successfully used statistical methods to analyze reading ease
Unlike most other formulas, it uses only a vocabulary element, making it useful for texts without complete sentences.
'''Readability''' is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text.
Like Dale and Tyler, they focused on what makes books readable for adults of limited reading ability.
Until computers came along, word frequency lists were the best aids for grading reading ease of texts.
In 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list, the New Dale–Chall readability formula.
An 8th-grade text "...will reach about 50 percent of all American grown-ups," he wrote.
It correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.
"Our definition of cohesion consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text."
Kitson's work showed that each type of reader bought and read their own type of text.
:New reading ease score = 1.599nosw &minus; 1.015sl &minus; 31.517
This means, if you are writing for a 5th-grade audience, study and learn good quality 5th-grade materials.
The Flesch–Kincaid formula is one of the most popular and heavily tested formulas.
He showed that the measures of reading ease worked as well for adults as for children.
Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations.
*average grade level of words
By the year 2000, there were over 1,000 studies on readability formulas in professional journals about their validity and merit.
He created two new lists of his own.
He chose the 8th-grade breakpoint because that was the average reading level of adult readers.
* Based on Army-job reading materials.
Bonnie Meyer and others tried to use organization as a measure of reading ease.
R. C. Calfee and R. Curley built on Bonnie Meyer's work and found that an unfamiliar underlying structure can make even simple text hard to read.
Schramm also found that the use of subheads, bold-face paragraphs, and stars to break up a story actually lose readers.
In 1983, 'Susan Kemper devised a formula based on physical states and mental states.
In 1931, Douglas Waples and Ralph Tyler published ''What Adults Want to Read About.''
Sherman's work established that:
The same things that children find hard are the same for adults of the same reading levels.
* The use of images.
The most popular novels are written at the 7th-grade level.
This has used many successful formulas: in research, government, teaching,  publishing, the military, medicine, and business.
Coh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the mental representation of the text.
John Bormuth of the University of Chicago looked at reading ease using the new Cloze deletion test developed by Wilson Taylor.
For centuries, teachers and educators have seen the importance of organization, coherence, and emphasis in good writing.
Text leveling is commonly used to rank the reading ease of texts in areas where reading difficulties are easy to identify, such as books for young children.
Their formula had a correlation of .645 with comprehension as measured by reading tests given to about 800 adults.
Their book included the first scientific study of the reading skills of American adults.
The project also used the reading records of more than 30,000 who read and were tested on 950,000 books.
The best level for unassisted reading is one for which readers can correctly answer 80 percent of the questions.
He used his 16 passages to compare and judge the reading ease of other texts, a method now called ''scaling''.
*Feedback and interaction with the teacher are the most important factors in reading.
Wilber Schramm interviewed 1,050 newspaper readers.
Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) + 3.6365
About one-third read at the 2nd to 6th-grade level, one-third at the 7th to 12th-grade level, and one-third at the 13th–17th grade level.
It also provided a basis for future research on reading ease.
Gray and Leary then analyzed 228 variables that affect reading ease and divided them into four types:
It is often recommended for use in healthcare.
Other studies by Klare showed how the reader's skills, prior knowledge, interest, and motivation affect reading ease.
Even though colleges  had long tried to teach how to write in a clear and readable style, Bryson found that it was rare.
Ojemann emphasized the reported features, such as whether the text was coherent or unduly abstract.
Study the texts used by your audience and their reading habits.
She found that a visible plan for presenting content greatly helps readers to assess a text.
The Lexile Book Database has more than 100,000 titles from more than 450 publishers.
Sherman wrote: "Literary English, in short, will follow the forms of standard spoken English from which it comes.
In 1934, Ralph Ojemann investigated adult reading skills, factors that most directly affect reading ease, and causes of each level of difficulty.
The Flesch Reading Ease formula became one of the most widely used, and the one most tested and reliable.
It takes training, method, and practice.
:ASL = Average sentence length
The study of reading is not just in teaching.
# Compute this equation
From these texts, he took 1,500 words he thought most people understood.
Their formula used five variable inputs and six constants.
Investigators in many fields began using it to improve communications.
* Diagrams and line graphs.
The earliest reading ease assessment is the subjective judgment termed ''text leveling''.
*Advanced readers need 92% comprehension for independent reading.
Among other things, Bormuth confirmed that vocabulary and sentence length are the best indicators of reading ease.
The best level for classroom "assisted reading" is a slightly difficult text that causes a "set to learn," and for which readers can correctly answer 50 percent of the questions of a multiple-choice test.
A study in 1947 by Melvin Lostutter showed that newspapers generally were written at a level five years above the ability of average American adult readers.
