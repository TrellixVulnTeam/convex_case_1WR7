Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures.
Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of point mutation, by a process called ''somatic hypermutation'' (SHM).
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist.
It has been shown to activate basophils and mast cells to produce antimicrobial factors.
Heterodimeric antibodies, which are also asymmetrical and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms.

This region is called the ''Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region'', and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody.
Those cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies.
These domains contain about 70–110 amino acids and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.
These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).
They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved amino acid residues.

In research, purified antibodies are used in many applications.
His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the side-chain theory for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as "side-chains") on the surface of cells could bind specifically to toxins&nbsp;– in a "lock-and-key" interaction&nbsp;– and that this binding reaction is the trigger for the production of antibodies.
It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.
Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment).
In placental mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.
Antibodies are used in flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins.
Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge.
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.
Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).
One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells.
According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different paratopes, and thus different antigen specificities.
Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins.
Antibody mimetics are organic compounds that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens.
Often, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an immune complex, which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies.

Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability.
The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects.
In mammals there are two types of immunoglobulin light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ).

The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε).
They have a characteristic immunoglobulin fold in which two beta sheets create a "sandwich" shape, held together by interactions between conserved cysteines and other charged amino acids.
While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (IgA); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka discovered IgE and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions.
Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, result in partial or complete lack of antibodies.
The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, is known as a "naive B lymphocyte."

In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain).
V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains.
It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).
Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by other researchers).
In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called ''polyvalent'' (or ''unspecific'') if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms.

Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.
This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens.
Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region).
Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes.
Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged.
The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.

Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens.
Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.
The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.
Some parts of an antibody have the same functions.
Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.
Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies in the form of human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.
The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.

Rho(D) immune globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D (RhD) antigen.
The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe.
However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming.
After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as allelic exclusion) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.
