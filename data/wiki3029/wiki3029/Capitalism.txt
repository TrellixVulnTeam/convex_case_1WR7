It was described by Adam Smith in ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776) and later economists as allocating productive resources to their most highly valued uses
States with capitalistic economic systems have thrived under political regimes deemed to be authoritarian or oppressive.
Instead of a serf-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy.
In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that the working class, due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism, would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution.
For Marx, the use of labor power had itself become a commodity under capitalism; the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.
This makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy.
''Capitalist'' is derived from ''capital'', which evolved from ''capitale'', a late Latin word based on ''caput'', meaning "head" — also the origin of ''chattel'' and ''cattle'' in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock).

The term capitalist mode of production is defined by private ownership of the means of production, extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation, wage-based labour, and, at least as far as commodities are concerned, being market-based.
The Aggregate Demand – Aggregate Supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand.
While the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves.
Capitalist governments have also been criticised as oligarchic in nature due to the inevitable inequality characteristic of economic progress.

In this description demand is rent: “The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers” and “that which regulates the price... of goods is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.”
For instance, Austrian economist Henry Hazlitt explains: “If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself."
Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and William Wells Brown did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply.

Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller.
The modern unemployed would refer primarily to the ''floating reserve,'' people who used to have good jobs, but are now out of work.
Not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs.
Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve.
In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market.

This argument is intertwined with Marx' version of the labor theory of value arguing that labor is the source of all value, and thus of profit.
Many economic and political theories advocate for an economy without the profit system and thus the profit motive.
Fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society's requirements.

To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the ''Marshallian partial'' equilibrium box of ''constant'' cost is even more empty than the box of ''increasing'' cost."
That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx' conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a ''class dependent on wages'', the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!
