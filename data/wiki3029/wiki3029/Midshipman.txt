Air Force no longer uses the warrant officer ranks, the U.S. Public Health Service and U.S. Maritime Service, while authorized warrant officers, have never appointed or commissioned warrant officers, and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is not authorized warrant officers.)
The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about seamanship, navigation, and discipline.
George Bancroft, appointed Secretary of the Navy in 1845, decided to work outside of congressional approval and create a new academy for officers.
Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors.

Officers without a degree have the option of earning a university degree while serving in the Navy.
Cadets who received a first-class passing grade in studies, seamanship and conduct on their final examination could receive a credit for up to a year of sea time, and could be rated as midshipmen immediately after passing out of the college.
In 1794, officers' servants were abolished and a new class of volunteers called 'volunteer class I' was created for boys between the ages of 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a ship-of-the-line or with the midshipmen on a frigate or smaller vessel.
By restricting the French officer corps to members of the nobility, there were not enough ''Gardes'' to man all of the ships during wartime.

Midshipmen at the United States Merchant Marine Academy study a similar core curriculum, except they are split into deck (navigation oriented) and engineering programs.
By an act of Congress passed in 1903, two appointments as midshipmen were allowed for each senator, representative, and delegate in Congress, two for the District of Columbia, and five each year at large.
As part of the act, the rank of midshipman was replaced with the rank of naval cadet.

Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'.
A nomination does not guarantee an appointment and in a typical year only about 38% of nominees receive an appointment.
Other nomination sources include the secretary of the Navy, who may appoint 170&nbsp;enlisted members of the regular and reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year, and the president may nominate an unlimited number of children of career military personnel for up to 100&nbsp;appointments each year.

Additionally, they spend a year at sea working as cadets on U.S. flagged merchant ships, visiting ports around the world.
Midshipmen were expected to work on the ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship.
A midshipman who became master's mate earned an increase in pay from £2&nbsp;5s to £3&nbsp;16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master's mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background.
The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.
Students at the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) are appointed as midshipmen in the United States Navy Reserve.
They are assigned to operations, weapons engineering, mechanical engineering, or logistics.

The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.
Cadets initially spend a year training at the South African Naval College in Gordon's Bay, about 55&nbsp;km southeast of Cape Town, and upon graduation are commissioned as midshipmen.
Midshipmen specializing in warfare remain at the college for the Initial Warfare Officer's Foundation course, which completes part of a foundation degree in naval studies (equating to two thirds of a bachelor's degree), on completion of initial professional training.
Two popular stories give origins for the term: the first claims that it arose from a shortage of handkerchiefs among midshipmen, who would consequently use their sleeves to wipe their noses.

Upon completion of Initial Fleet Time, officer cadets return to Dartmouth for four weeks to complete their final leadership assessment, the Maritime Leadership Exercise (MARL), and a week spent with different areas of the Royal Navy.
Unlike midshipmen in the Royal Navy, the ''Gardes'' trained mostly on shore and focused on military drill and theory rather than practical skills in gunnery, navigation and seamanship.
They must pass a two-and-a-half-day assessment, called the Admiralty Interview Board, and a medical examination.
During the second seven weeks, officer cadets learn essential sea officer skills, including navigation and the marine environment, strategic studies, and basic sea survival.

Over time, however, appointment to master's mate became considered a normal part of the path to a commission; the situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles&nbsp;– master's mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission&nbsp;– held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.
Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out.

They study humanities, engineering, professional and technical subjects.
Upon graduation, midshipmen are commissioned as ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps.
The French rank of ''garde de la marine'' was established in 1670, when an office of the monarchy selected young gentlemen from the nobility to serve the King in the Gardes de la Marine.

They were expected to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants.
Volunteers were paid £6 per year.
During the 19th century, changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college.
Spencer had gained his post aboard the ''Somers'' via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.
Like the board, which might be an ''ad hoc'' affair, the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains.
On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore.
From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission.
The board would ask questions such as:
One major reason for the delay was that Navy leaders preferred the apprenticeship system, citing famous officers such as Nelson and the captains of the War of 1812 who did not attend a formal naval school.
Similarly, in Italy naval officer cadets, called ''allievo dell'accademia navale'', are promoted to the rank of ''aspirante guardiamarina'' in their final year, and the lowest rank of commissioned officer is ''guardiamarina'', both terms which translate to midshipman.

Officially, a prospective lieutenant was at least 19, and was expected to produce proof of his service, which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman.
During the long period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few opportunities for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage.
The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more.
Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.
The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.
By the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary.
The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy.
Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27&nbsp;percent of officers.
Prior to promotion to lieutenant, a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination.

After 1957 midshipmen no longer served in the fleet.
A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785.
By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served at least three years as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities.
Beginning in 1903, officer training of military and engineering students was reformed by the Selborne-Fisher scheme, and engineering and executive officer candidates began to enter the Navy in the same way, which was termed 'Common Entry'.
The rank of midshipman originated during the Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training.
The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662.
Their official rating was volunteer-per-order, but they were often known as King's letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.
Congress formally authorized the establishment of the United States Military Academy in 1802, but it took almost 50&nbsp;years to approve a similar school for naval officers.

The Dutch navy has since the early 17th century included a midshipman rank which literally means 'young gentleman' (); today, ''adelborsten'' train at the Royal Netherlands Naval College () for 3 years.
In 1903 a new preparatory school was opened at Royal Naval College, Osborne, which was Queen Victoria's favorite residence but was not a favorite of her successor Edward VII who had donated it to the nation in 1902.
Legally, midshipmen are a special grade of officer that ranks between the senior enlisted grade (E-9) and the lowest grade of chief warrant officer (W-2, U. S. Navy  or U.S. Coast Guard) or warrant officer (W-1, U. S. Army or U. S. Marine Corps.
In the 17th century, a midshipman was a rating for an experienced seaman, and the word derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed.
Contemporary French naval officer training still reflects this structure: students at the École navale begin their the first year as ''élève-officier'', are promoted in their second year to ''aspirant'', and in their third year are commissioned as an acting sub-lieutenant ().
Midshipman began to mean "passed midshipman" at this time, and a student at the Naval Academy was a cadet midshipman.
After passing out they are appointed midshipmen, and undertake another six months of training at sea.
If they have been successful, officers of all branches then pass out of the college.
After 30&nbsp;months of total training they are promoted to the final officer candidate rank, ''Oberfähnrich zur See'', equivalent to the NCO rank ''Hauptbootsmann'', and after about 4&nbsp;years of total training graduate with a bachelor's degree.
During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.
By the 1730s, the rating volunteer-per-order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers.
During the first seven weeks of training, officer cadets learn militarization and sea sense, focusing on learning about the military environment, along with team and leadership skills.
A decline in qualified officers prompted the Navy to order training in a ship at anchor for all cadets, which began in 1857 aboard HMS ''Illustrious'', which was replaced by HMS ''Britannia'' in 1859.
Currently each member of Congress and the vice president can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time.
At graduation they have two options, a job in the maritime industry ashore or sailing aboard commercial vessels plus a naval reserve commission, or an active-duty commission in the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard as an ensign or second lieutenant.
After completing their initial training course, midshipmen serve aboard ships for a short time, followed by specialty training for 16&nbsp;weeks.
After five total years of training and having reached the age of 19, the midshipmen were eligible to take the examination for lieutenant.
Passed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master's mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the master with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats.
Some men never passed it.
In a modern French-English dictionary, ''élève officier'' translates to midshipman, but both the historical term ''garde-marine'' and the modern term for an officer candidate, ''aspirant'', are also equivalent to midshipman.
Beginning in 1677, Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea.
In 1874, Congress changed the curriculum to include four years of classroom training and two years of sea duty aboard a regular vessel prior to examinations as warranted midshipmen.
These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator's branch.
These professional officers wore blue uniforms to distinguish them from the ''Gardes de la Marine'' who wore red uniforms.
They also began wearing their traditional badge of rank, a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar.
Officers can complete degrees via distance learning with the Open University, although completion is not required.
After passing the examination for lieutenant, midshipmen were commissioned as sub-lieutenants, and were transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, which opened in 1873 as the 'University of the Navy'.
Officers who entered the service with a university degree are promoted to sub-lieutenant after completion of Junior Officer Common Training.
Until they have completed initial fleet training, both midshipmen and sub-lieutenants at Britannia Royal Naval College do not use their substantive ranks, but instead use the rank of officer cadet.
Midshipmen at the US Naval Academy study a core curriculum plus 21 major fields of study, a wide variety of elective courses and advanced study and research opportunities, as well as a required "surface cruise" with an active vessel during the summer.
After passing the final fleet examination, they are promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant.
After approximately two years in the Navy, midshipmen are promoted to ensign.
These ranks all refer to young naval officer cadets, but the selection, training and responsibilities of each diverge from the British tradition.
