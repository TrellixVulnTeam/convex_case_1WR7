In addition to echolocating prey, bat ears are sensitive to the fluttering of moth wings, the sounds produced by tymbalate insects, and the movement of ground-dwelling prey, such as centipedes, earwigs, etc.
Non heraldic organizations also use bats in their symbols.
Researchers have proposed alternative views of chiropteran phylogeny and classification, but more research is needed.
The bat needed to eat, so he flew out of hiding every night to hunt for food to avoid being arrested.
'''Bats''' are mammals of the order '''Chiroptera''' (; from the  - ''cheir'', "hand" and  - ''pteron'', "wing") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight.
The smallest bat is the Kitti's hog-nosed bat, measuring  in length,  across the wings and  in mass.
These bats favor fleshy and sweet fruits, but not those particularly strong smelling or colorful.
In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals.
However, more often than not, a bat will use its tail membrane or wings to scoop up the insect and trap it in a sort of "bug net".
Studies also show that bats make various sounds in order to communicate with one another.
When all his feathers were gone, the bat became distressed and ashamed of his appearance.
They use echolocation to detect tiny ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it.
The first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in Chiroptera, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids.
**** Rhinopomatidae (Mouse-tailed bats)
This is referred to as hematophagy.
The bat then served his soup out of the soup pot, both tasted it.
The distinctive features noted on the ''Onychonycteris'' fossil also support the claim that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal gliders, rather than terrestrial runners.
**** Hipposideridae (Old World leaf-nosed bats)
The bat is sometimes used as a heraldic symbol in Spain.
This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness.

These bats were placed in a room in total darkness, with silk threads strung across the room.
**** Molossidae (Free-tailed bats)
They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.
Genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, along with carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans.
According to a particular East Nigerian tale, the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat.
When at night, the bat and the bush-rat would alternate in cooking duties, cooking what was caught, and eat together.
This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals.
In the United States, bats typically constitute around a quarter of reported cases of rabies in wild animals.
During the U.S. Civil War, guano was used to make gunpowder.
** Suborder Megachiroptera (megabats)
Bats hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, minimizing contact with certain predators, and travel large distances (up to 800&nbsp;km) in their search for food.
those affecting most terrestrial carnivores/omnivores) evolved from strains that were originally endemic to bats.
The search to arrest the bat carried on over several days, but he still could not be found.
Different species select different habitats during different seasons, ranging from seasides to mountains and even deserts, but bat habitats have two basic requirements: roosts, where they spend the day or hibernate, and places for foraging.
A recent study by Zhang et al.
In 2006, Sears et al.
Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.
Using a locally native species, the little brown bat, he discovered that bats use echolocation to locate and catch their prey.
*** Superfamily Vespertilionoidea
*** Superfamily Molossoidea
Public health organizations such as the CDC generally recommend that any contact with a potentially infected animal (including any bat) be reported promptly, and those at risk of infection are treated with a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen to prevent contraction of the virus, which is near-universally fatal with very few exceptions.
Most temperate species additionally need a relatively warm hibernation shelter.
However, recent results show that there are at least two species of bat, the frugivorous bat (''Rousettus leschenaultii'') and insectivorous bat (''Hipposideros armiger''), that have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.
By folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke, they save 35 percent energy during flight.
They perform the vital ecological roles of pollinating flowers and dispersing fruit seeds; many tropical plant species depend entirely on bats for the distribution of their seeds.
Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.

When the chief's men went looking for the bat, he could not be found.
Finally, in 1995, the bats moved in permanently, and the colony has continued to grow.
However, the well-preserved skeleton showed that the small cochlea of the inner ear did not have the morphology necessary to echolocate.
The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus not only echolocation signals, but also to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey.
Evidence suggests that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind farms.
They emit calls outside of this range to avoid self-deafening.
By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings.

The new suborder of Yinpterochiroptera includes the Pteropodidae, or megabat family, as well as the families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae, and Rhinopomatidae The other new suborder, Yangochiroptera, includes all of the remaining families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation).
They also seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a potential commensal/mutualistic relationship or specific adaptations to the bats' immune systems.
They serve as the natural reservoirs for the rabies virus.
Consequently, two new suborders based on molecular data have been proposed.
The social structure of bats varies, with some leading solitary lives and others living in caves colonized by more than a million bats.
Almost three-fourths of the world's bats are insect eaters.
They are also implicated in the emergence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), since they serve as a natural host for the type of virus involved (the genus Coronavirus, whose members typically cause mild respiratory disease in humans).
**** Myzopodidae (Sucker-footed bats)
Other species exhibit delayed implantation, in which the egg is fertilized after mating, but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favorable for giving birth and caring for the offspring.
This may be due to overwhelming competition from more effective, specialized parasites, such as the bat bugs which occupy the same niche.

It is up to them to find and catch their prey, along with satisfying their thirst.
A few species, specifically the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood.
Analyses of the sequence of the "vocalization" gene, ''FoxP2'', were inconclusive as to whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages.
Although the eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind.
Instead, they rely on the sounds produced by the insects.
The fungus was first discovered in central New York State in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire Eastern US north of Florida; mortality rates of 90–100% have been observed in most caves.
The study found no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years.
The disease is named after a white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, found growing on the muzzles, ears, and wings of afflicted bats.
The common vampire bat typically feeds on mammals, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead.
A large portion of bats migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active.
Genetic evidence indicates that megabats originated during the early Eocene and should be placed within the four major lines of microbats.
Fossilized remains of bats are few, as they are terrestrial and light-boned.

Since there are no signs of external trauma, the cause has been hypothesized to be a greater sensitivity to sudden pressure fluctuations in the mammalian lung than in that of birds.
In addition to Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, the names Pteropodiformes and Vespertilioniformes have also been proposed for these suborders.
To his pleasure, he found that the bats with plugged ears were not able to fly with the same amount of skill and precision as they were able to without their ears plugged.
**** Antrozoidae (Pallid bat and Van Gelder's bat)

Bat images were engraved onto funerary urns, and were emphasized with large claws and round ears by Zapotecs.
In 2009, part of the original bat house collapsed: a new "Bat Barn" was constructed next to it, and the interior of the original was rebuilt.
This conclusion is further supported by a 15-base-pair deletion in BRCA1 and a seven-base-pair deletion in PLCB4 present in all Yangochiroptera and absent in all Yinpterochiroptera.
Because bats are mammals, yet can fly, this gives them status as liminal beings in many cultural traditions.
These bats locate large groups of frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth.
Two groups of moths exploit a bat sense to echolocate: tiger moths produce ultrasonic signals to warn the bats that they (the moths) are chemically protected or aposematic, other moth species produce signals to jam bat echolocation.

They pull the fruit off the trees with their teeth, then fly back to their roosts to consume them, sucking out the juice and spitting the seeds and pulp out onto the ground.
Young microbats become independent at the age of six to eight weeks, while megabats do not until they are four months old.
The phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate.
finneyi'' lacked an enlarged orbical apophysis on the malleus, and a stylohyal element with an expanded paddle-like cranial tip—both of which are characteristics linked to echolocation in other prehistoric and extant bat species.
The membranes are also delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly.
In New Guinea, they are likely to have evolved for some time in the absence of microbats, which has resulted in some smaller megabats of the genus ''Nyctimene'' becoming (partly) insectivorous to fill the vacant microbat ecological niche.
The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo.
The finger bones of bats are much more flexible than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips.

However, unlike raccoon or skunk bites, bat bites may go ignored or unnoticed and hence untreated.
To prove this theory, Spallanzani plugged the ears of the bats in his experiment.
"In the myths, the beast of prey and the animal that is preyed upon play two significant roles.
The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey.
The means by which bats navigate while finding and catching their prey in the dark was unknown until the 1790s, when Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted a series of experiments on a group of hooded and surgically blinded bats.
In yet another strategy, fertilization and implantation both occur, but development of the fetus is delayed until favorable conditions prevail, during the delayed development the mother still gives the fertilized egg nutrients, and oxygenated blood to keep it alive.
This is likely an important tool for thermoregulation, allowing the bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane (many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose).
Bat echolocation is a perceptual system where ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes.
Watching a bat catch and eat an insect is difficult.
This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species.

These two new suborders are strongly supported by statistical tests.
The birds all agreed and began to pluck one feather from their bodies to give to the bat.
Where rabies is not endemic, as throughout most of Western Europe, small bats can be considered harmless.
Microbats use vision to navigate, especially for long distances when beyond the range of echolocation, and species that are gleaners—that is, ones that attempt to swoop down from above to ambush insects, like crickets on the ground or moths up a tree, often have eyesight about as good as a rat's.
These bats typically fly down and grasp their prey off the ground with their teeth, and take it to a nearby perch to eat it.
However, analyses of the "hearing" gene, ''Prestin'', seemed to favor the independent gain in echolocating species rather than a secondary loss in the pteropodids.

Rabies is considered fully preventable if the patient is administered a vaccine prior to the onset of symptoms.
This model of flight development, commonly known as the "trees-down" theory, implies that bats attained powered flight by taking advantage of height and gravity, rather than relying on running speeds fast enough for a ground-level take off.
