Temperature is another major factor, if the organisms that contain the enzymes are too cold to grow, then biodegradation is severely hindered.
Another option is developing better biodegradable filters; much of this work relies heavily on the research in the secondary mechanism for photodegradation as stated above, but a new research group has developed an acid tablet that goes inside the filters, and once wet enough, releases acid that speeds up the degradation to around two weeks.
While the assembly of cigarettes is straightforward, much focus is given to the creation of each of the components, in particular the tobacco blend.

This caused 520 deaths and 1,600 people injured.
Some look like traditional cigarettes, but they come in many variations.
Thus, the primary photodegradation of cellulose acetate is considered insignificant to the total degradation process, since cellulose acetate and its impurities absorb light at shorter wavelengths.
Smoking cessation can be achieved with or without assistance from healthcare professionals or the use of medications.
Modern commercially manufactured cigarettes are seemingly simple objects consisting mainly of a tobacco blend, paper, PVA glue to bond the outer layer of paper together, and often also a cellulose acetate–based filter.

estimated trash (4.5 trillion)
Recent research has been put into finding ways to use the filter waste to develop a desired product.
The first step in the biodegradation of cellulose acetate is the deactylation of the acetate from the polymer chain (which is the opposite of acetylation).
