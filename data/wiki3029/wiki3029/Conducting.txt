There he was a student of Gunther Schuller and Seiji Ozawa, and it was at that time that he first worked with Leonard Bernstein.
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...;But owning authority and power in public is another matter.
Nikisch premiered important works by Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who greatly admired his work; Johannes Brahms, after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony, said it was "quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better."
An early form of conducting is cheironomy, the use of hand gestures to indicate melodic shape.
Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat.
Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).
Petrenko stated that "when conducted by a man, orchestral musicians encounter fewer erotic distractions."
Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor.
The beat of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton.
Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski (1882–1977), Otto Klemperer (1885–1973), Herbert von Karajan (1908–1989) and Leonard Bernstein (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.
Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax.
To carry out and to control a rallentando (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.
While a student at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, he spent a summer at the Oberlin College Conservatory at Tanglewood.
The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.
Conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance.
stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.
This has been practiced at least as far back as the Middle Ages.
There were "...protests from a large swathe of the Baltimore Symphony when she was first named Music Director", but since that time, "plaudits have rolled in."
As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's Symphony No.
He also made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony: the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913.
An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible "sniff" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors.
Typically, orchestral conductors use a baton more often than choral conductors.
Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.
The composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject.
and/or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready.
The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.
Some conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts.
Yet just as the music played by these ensembles has expanded over the years, the ethnicities of the musicians who lead such groups have expanded to include more minorities.
He then held posts as associate conductor of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra from 1968-1970 and Detroit Symphony Orchestra from 1970-1979.
*James DePreist (1936-2013) was one of the first African-American conductors on the world stage.
Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the pipe organ, a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct.
Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways.
The large staff was responsible for the death of Jean-Baptiste Lully, who injured his foot with one while conducting a Te Deum for the King's recovery from illness.
Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).
The next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born Arthur Nikisch (1855–1922), who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895.
Lewis founded the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.
His operatic debut was in 1982 at the Vienna State Opera.
Conductors of concert bands, military bands, marching bands and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''.
The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music.
is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.
Conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression (tempo, dynamics, articulation) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble.
Bruckner or Stravinsky will not do, but Debussy is OK.
Dynamics are indicated in various ways.
Conductors of choirs or choruses are sometimes referred to as ''choral director,'' ''chorus master,'' or ''choirmaster,'' particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra.
In 2013, "Vasily Petrenko, the principal conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them' because 'a cute girl on the podium means that musicians think about other things.'"
The preparatory beat before the orchestra and/or choir begins is the upbeat.
In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors – the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.
In 2014, Alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the Last Night of the Proms concert–one of the most important classical music events in Britain–in its 118-year history.
Notable female conductors include:
*Henry Lewis (1932-1996) attended The University of Southern California and at age 16, joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic, becoming the first black instrumentalist in a major symphony orchestra.
* Dean Dixon (1915-1976) studied conducting with Albert Stoessel at the Juilliard School and Columbia University.
Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use today.
The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.
Among the earliest notable conductors were Louis Spohr, Carl Maria von Weber, Louis-Antoine Jullien and Felix Mendelssohn, all of whom were also composers.
*Natalia Luis-Bassa
String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief.
Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required.
There are a small number of female conductors who have become top-ranked international conductors.
To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.
Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra.
When early pursuits of conducting engagements were stifled because of racial bias (he was African American), he formed his own orchestra and choral society in 1931.
He is to this day regarded by such authorities as James Levine as the greatest of all Verdi conductors.
Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework.
In 1948 he won the Ditson Conductor's Award.
in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts.
Articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for staccato, to long and fluid for legato.
Conservatories, which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience.
Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently.
Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time.
He won first prize in the Dimitri Mitropoulos International Conducting Competition.
In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized.
He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1972.
While a handful of conductors have become well-known celebrities, such as Leonard Bernstein, most are only known within the Classical music scene.
Finnish conductor Jorma Panula, who was named as one of the "60 most powerful people in music" in a November 2000 issue of ''BBC Music Magazine'', provided his views on female conductors in a 2014 television interview.
Predecessors who focused on conducting include François Habeneck, who founded the Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal.
He was the first African-American to lead a major symphony orchestra.
During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section.
More information on women conductors is provided below.
Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.
The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.
Alsop was appointed music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2007 – the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra – and also of the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of The Proms.
If the tempo is slow or slowing, or if the time signature is compound, a conductor will sometimes indicate "subdivisions" of the beats.
He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist Heinrich Schenker, who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting.
As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music.
Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A.
Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.
Conductors of African, Caribbean or African-American ancestry include:
Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.
Dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume.
Conductors act as guides to the orchestras and/or choirs they conduct.
This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement.
Freeman earned bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees from the Eastman School of Music.
In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized.
Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities.
Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time.
The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the "preparation", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the "" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).
Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in").
A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid.
More information on black conductors is provided below.
However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.
The second hand can be used for cueing the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.
Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period.
Wagner's one-time champion Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter Cosima he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner.
In the Christian church, the person giving these symbols held a staff to signify his role, and it seems that as music became more rhythmically involved, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of baton.
Women conductors were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like Marin Alsop and Simone Young have broken the gender barrier.
*Paul Freeman (1936-2015) was a conductor, composer, and founder of the Chicago Sinfonietta.

He was then chosen by Leonard Bernstein to become assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic during the 1965/66 season.
or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree).
He was the Director Emeritus of Conducting and Orchestral Studies at The Juilliard School and Laureate Music Director of the Oregon Symphony.
In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period.
Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, ''maestro'' ("master" as in "one who has mastered the art").
Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training.
This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played and/or for the choristers to be ready and watching.
He stated that "women conductors… Of course they are trying!
Toscanini played in orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting ''Aida'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor.
The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way).
A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.
In 2014, "...''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women."
Conductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts.
Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music.
Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus.
The essence of a woman is weakness."
Bülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra ("sectional rehearsal").
They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini (1867–1957) and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler (1886–1954).
Conductors of ensembles that play mainly European Classical music as core repertory have tended to be Caucasian.
Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.
They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media.
In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as youth orchestras, school orchestras and community orchestras.

The majority of professional orchestra conductors are male; ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last glass ceilings in the music industry".
Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras.
A small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting.
They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers.
Composer Gustav Mahler was also a noted conductor.
In some instances, "ictus" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a music stand where a baton is tapped at each ictus.
Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common.
For example, in a 4/4 piece that the conductor will beat "in two" (two ictus points or beats per bar), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his or her chest.
In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite.
Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed.
Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."
'''Conducting''' is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert.
In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to Eb clarinet).
*Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla
Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a crescendo; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a diminuendo.
As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context.
A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up.
Among prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include Pierre Boulez, Kurt Masur, James Conlon, and Yuri Temirkanov.
The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gestures is also beneficial.
*Michael Morgan (born 1957) is music director of the Oakland East Bay Symphony and the Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra, and artistic director of  Festival Opera in Walnut Creek, California.
In his posts as head of (sequentially) the Bavarian State Opera, Meiningen Court Orchestra, and Berlin Philharmonic he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like Richard Strauss, who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and Felix Weingartner, who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards.
Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.
Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo.
The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra.
The indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called "cueing".
In 1941, he guest-conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic during its summer season.
He gained national recognition in 1961 when he was appointed assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta.

9 – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an "ugly" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).
It was common to conduct from the harpsichord in pieces that had a basso continuo part.
Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.
While some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach.
A senior conductor may attend some or all of the auditions for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards.
Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side.
In 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.
The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper.

Changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat.
In January 2005, Australian conductor Simone Young became the first woman to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic.
In 1980, he won first prize in the Hans Swarovsky International Conductors Competition in Vienna, Austria and became Assistant Conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, under Leonard Slatkin.
The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study conducting in music school; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of conducting doctorates were women.
This was sometimes the concertmaster, who could use his bow as a baton, or a lutenist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat.
With an abrupt, loud sforzando chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.
If they take more feminine music.
The downbeat indicates the first beat of the bar, and the upbeat indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar.
A DMA in conducting is a terminal degree, and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories.
During an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.
The primary duties of the '''conductor''' are to set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.
Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the New York Philharmonic (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe.
Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also a conductor.
Cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note.
In some cases, a conductor will also be the musical director of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on.
The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and/or voices.
Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the Hamburg State Opera and Philharmoniker Hamburg in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner.
He later guest-conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra and Boston Symphony Orchestra.
The wound became gangrenous and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.
There is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession, but there have been notable exceptions, such as Henry Lewis, Dean Dixon, James DePreist, Paul Freeman, and Michael Morgan.
Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements.
Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.
Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor.
On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts.
Conductors aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor.
In some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see).
Bruno Mantovani, the director of the Paris Conservatoire, gave an interview about women conductors in which he raised the "problem of maternity" and ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession, which he described as involving "conducting, taking a plane, taking another plane, conducting again."
