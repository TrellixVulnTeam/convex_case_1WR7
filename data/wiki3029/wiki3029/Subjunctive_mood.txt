However, not all "que" clauses require the subjunctive mood.
'He asked that I go.
The '''subjunctive''' is a grammatical mood found in many languages.
German has two forms of the subjunctive mood, namely '''Konjunktiv I''' (KI) 'present subjunctive' and '''Konjunktiv II''' (KII) 'past subjunctive'.
*** When '''you're older''' (present ind.
''si estuvieras'': "if you were..."
'''Present subjunctive'''
Likewise, the indicative ''can'' as in ''He can do it now'' has the subjunctive form ''could'' as in ''I wish that he could do it now''.
"If /Maybe you write") (s.f)
In Spanish, the pluperfect subjunctive tense is used to describe a continuing wish in the past.
The subjunctive is used in conjunction with impersonal expressions and expressions of emotion, opinion, desire or viewpoint.
* Ele pensou que eu '''era''' alto ''(He thought that I was tall and I am or I am not sure whether I am or not)''
In this particular example, ''you will be older'' and it is then that ''you will understand''.
Verbs with a contracted infinitive, such as ''dire'' (short for ''dicere'') revert to the longer form in the imperfect subjunctive (to give ''dicessi'' etc., for example).
'''Time of action'''
There are a few exceptions where the usage is clearly subjunctive, like: "''Mogen zij in vrede rusten''" (May they rest in peace); compare to singular: "''Moge hij/zij in vrede rusten''" (May he/she rest in peace).
* Indicative third singular masc.
* English: "It is possible that they might have to leave".
Present subjunctive
Should I stay longer?
(The corresponding indicative forms of the verbs in bold would be ''are'' and ''stays''.)
* ''Dudo que'' el restaurante abra (abrir) a las seis.
However, unlike in French, where it is often replaced with the present subjunctive, the imperfect subjunctive is far more common.
For instance: "It was required that he '''go''' to the back of the line" (compared with the past indicative "Everyone knows that he '''went''' to the back of the line"); and "It is required that he '''go''' to the back of the line" (compared with the present indicative "Everyone knows that he '''goes''' to the back of the line").
* ''Fuera lo que hubiera sido''.
* Italian: "“L’insegnante rallentava, affinché '''capissimo''' tutto."
* It is important that he '''choose''' (present sub.)
* English: "My parents want me to play the piano".
* ''Să-l (să o, să le etc.)
The subjunctive mood is formed using the ''by'' particle, either alone or forming a single word with the complex conjunctions ''żeby'', ''iżby'', ''ażeby'', ''aby'', ''coby''.
Note that "demand" is nowhere near as rude as it might come across in English.
When used independently, the subjunctive indicates a desire, a fear, an order or a request, i.e.
* (Law /Momken enti ḥatektebi.
(I doubt that the restaurant might open at six.)
For example: ''An deiner Stelle würde ich ihm nicht helfen'' 'I would not help him if I were you'.
* In the present tense, the singular form of the subjunctive differs from the indicative, having an extra ''-e''.
the right way—Tá sé tábhachtach go '''roghnaíonn''' (present indicative) sé ar an mbealach ceart.
* Portuguese: ''Quando '''fores''''' future subjunctive ''mais velho, compreenderás'' future indicative.''
''yaktubu'' "he writes / is writing / will write" → Subjunctive ''yaktuba'' "he may / should write"
In Portuguese, the subjunctive (''subjuntivo'' or ''conjuntivo'') is used to talk about situations which are seen as doubtful, imaginary, hypothetical, demanded, or required.
* Impersonal expressions are used in the main clause.
* ''Dumnezeu să-l (s-o, să-i, să le) ierte!''
"Desearía que (tú) hubieras ido al cine conmigo el viernes pasado."
Thus, it becomes "estuviese" or "estuviera".
(He asked me to go.)'
# in the first and third persons singular of the verb "be" in the past negative form.
The short version of the definite form also drops two letters, but another two.
El vrea ''să cânte'', he wants to sing).
In most cases, an umlaut is appended to the stem vowel if possible (i.e.
–  May God give you sense.
The subjunctive forms always include the conjunction ''să'', which within these verbal forms plays the role of a morphological structural element.
In Spanish, a present subjunctive form is always different from the corresponding present indicative form.
I '''owned'''he/she/it '''owned'''we/you/they '''owned'''
In many spoken Arabic dialects, there remains a distinction between indicative and subjunctive; however, it is not through a suffix but rather a prefix.
Below, there is a table demonstrating  subjunctive and conditional conjugation for regular verbs of the first paradigm (-ar), exemplified by ''falar'' (to speak) .
The past tense of the subjunctive mood has one form for all persons and numbers of all the verbs, which is ''să fi'' followed by the past participle of the verb.
* Indicative third plural masc.
(I wish that you had gone to the movies with me last Friday).
You should have stayed home.
Phrases expressing the subjunctive in a future period normally employ the present subjunctive.
It drops, for example: the ''-ja-'' in ''-jad,'' leaving just ''-d,'' as can be seen in ''add'' above (instead of ''adjad'').
with present subjunctive 'habe', one could use past subjunctive 'hätte': ''Es wurde gesagt, er ''hätte'' keine Zeit für so etwas.''
An unusual feature of the mood's endings is that there exist a short and a long form for the second person singular (i.e.
(Hallowed be Thy name (Belgian/Catholic version of Lord's Prayer).)
* ''Ojalá que'' me compren (comprar) un regalo.
The subjunctive mood (''subjuntivo'') is a fundamental element of Spanish.
In particular, there is no  ''żeby''.
* If I '''were''' (past subjunctive) you, I would study for the exam tomorrow.
* ''Zo waarlijk '''helpe''' mij God almachtig.''
(It's important that...)
E.g., the subjunctive "''hadde''", "''ware''" and "''mochte''" differ from the indicative "''had''", "''was''" and "''mocht''" ('had', 'was' and 'could').
* ''Sea lo que sea'' (present subjunctive + present subjunctive): "No matter what/whatever."
there is no conjunction, which would indicate the subjunctive.
:''kérte, hogy '''menjek'''.''
* ''Donde'': "Where.." (e.g.
The present subjunctive of the regular verbs is formed by adding specific endings to the stem of the infinitive (e.g.
–  'Give it to me.'
(So truly help me God almighty (when swearing an oath).)
Spanish and English will use the present tense in this type of clause.
* ''Aunque'': "Despite/although/even if..."
* Me alegro de que (tú) seas mi amiga.
'He told me he was not ready.'
They are almost identical, except that where the "first form" has ''-ra-'', the "second form" has ''-se-''.
if it is ''a'', ''o'', ''u'' or ''au''), for example: ''ich war'' → ''ich wäre'', ''ich brachte'' → ''ich brächte''.
* English: "It seemed that Elsa '''was not coming'''."
(to people who have finished their meals)
Bring me a glass of water!
The subjunctive is generally formed by taking the stem of the verb and adding on the appropriate subjunctive ending depending on broad or slender, and first or second conjugation.
* English: "The teacher slowed down, so that we '''would understand''' everything."
More importantly, it applies to most hypothetical situations, likely or unlikely, desired or not.
(to a child, after he or she declared his or her age or thanked for something)
Or again, the subjunctive of "tabhair" (give) is "tuga":
# in the first and third persons singular of the verb "be" in the past form;
'''First conjugation:'''
The present subjunctive is used in a range of situations in clauses taking the subjunctive.
The present subjunctive is used mostly in subordinate clauses, as in the examples above.
* Although '''feoigh''' doesn't have a ''fáda'' (accent), the 'o' in this position is stressed (pronounced as though it is '''ó''') and thus the subjunctive is irregular.
* Ele pensou que eu '''fosse''' alto ''(He thought that I was tall and I am not)
that I '''not be'''that he/she/it '''not be'''that we/you/they '''not be'''
* "'''יחי''' המלך" (''Y'khi ha-melekh'') — "Long '''live''' the king" (literally, "'''Live''' the-king")
Dutch has the same subjunctive tenses as German (described above), though they are rare in contemporary speech.
Only for strong verbs, the preterite-present verbs and some irregular weak verbs does the past subjunctive differ from the past indicative, and only in the singular form.
His claim may be true or it may not.
The optative was used to express wishes or hopes.
counterfactuality in ''wish'' or ''if'' clauses
Both forms are usually interchangeable although the ''-se-'' form may be more common in Spain than in other Spanish-speaking areas.
Romanian is part of the Balkan Sprachbund and as such uses the subjunctive (''conjunctivul'') more extensively than other Romance languages.
Then add the participle of the main verb (in this case "ir" becomes "ido").
* ''Si yo '''fuera'''/'''fuese''' el maestro, no mandaría demasiados deberes''.
Many dictionaries consider the Konjunktiv II forms of such verbs the only proper expression in formal written German.
"I would like you to come."
In many cases, the Romance languages use the subjunctive in the same ways that English does; however, they use them in other ways as well.
However, the second statement expresses a promise about the future; the speaker may yet be elected president.
* Go dtuga Dia ciall duit.
fear, happiness, sorrow, etc.)
Where the subjunctive is used in English, it may not be used in Irish and another tense might be used instead.
* ''Ar fi fost mai bine să mai fi stat.''
As usual, gemination of a final sibilant consonant is demonstrated when a ''j''-initial ending is applied:
), you'll understand – Nuair a '''bheidh'''/'''bheas''' (future ind.)
The verb "to be" is so distinguishable because its forms in Modern English derive from three different Old English verbs:  ''beon'' (be, being, been), ''wesan'' (was, is, wast), and ''wæron'' (am, art, are, were, wert).
The English subjunctive also occurs in counterfactual dependent clauses, using a form of the verb that in the indicative would indicate a time of action prior to the one implied by the subjunctive.
The past subjunctive is used after the past optative-conditional of the verbs that require the subjunctive (''a trebui, a vrea, a putea, a fi bine, a fi necesar'', etc.
* Se '''formos''' lá ''(If we go there)''
One difference between the French subjunctive and the Italian is that Italian uses the subjunctive after expressions like "Penso che" ("I think that"), where French would use the indicative.
that I '''be'''that he/she/it '''be'''that we/you/they '''be'''
The optative mood was formed with a suffix *''-ieh1'' or *''-ih1'' (with a laryngeal).
* ''Myślę, że gdyby wyszedł, ...'' conditional - I think, that if he would leave, ...
Some verbs don't follow the conjugation of the subjunctive exactly as conjugated above.
(The corresponding indicative would be "que hablan".)
As shown in the above table, the form of the subjunctive is distinguishable from the indicative in five circumstances:
* English: ''If '''I am''''' present indicative technical English is "if I '''be'''" present subjunctive elected president, I will change future indicative the law.''
''homme byukotbu'', versus ''yukotbu''
Note that there are authors who regard the conditional of Portuguese as a 'future in the past' of the indicative mood, rather than as a separate mood; they call it ''futuro do pretérito'' ("future of the past"), especially in Brazil.
I '''am not'''he/she/it '''is not'''we/you/they '''are not'''
However, in the case of the first-person plural, these languages have imperative forms: "Let us go" in French is "''Allons-y''".
In practice, potential subjunctive uses of verbs are difficult to differentiate from indicative uses.
** Spanish: ''Si '''fuera''''' imperfect subjunctive ''rey, acabaría con'' conditional ''el hambre.''
The formation of this for regular verbs differs between the indefinite and definite: the indefinite requires just the addition of ''-j,'' which differs from the longer ending in that the last two sounds are omitted (''-j'' and not ''-jél'' for example in ''menj'' above, cf.
''Ojalá que llueva (present subjunctive)'' "I hope it rains" or ''Ojalá que lloviera (past subjunctive)'' "I wish it would rain".
''cuando vaya'', "when I go".)
Common introductions to the subjunctive would include the following:
* ''Ar fi trebuit să fi rămas acasă.''
However, in Sanskrit, use of the subjunctive is found only in the Vedic language of the earliest times, and the optative and imperative are comparatively less commonly used.
"If /Maybe you would write") (s.f)
These include weak roots with a medial or final vowel, such as ''yaqūm'' "he rises / will rise" versus ''yaqom'' "may he rise" and ''yihye'' "he will be" versus ''yehi'' "may he be", imperfect forms of the ''hiphil'' stem, and also generally for first person imperfect forms: אֵשֵׁב (imperfect indicative of 'sit') vs. אֵשְׁבָה (imperfect cohortative=volitive of 'sit').
In the later language (from c. 500 BC), the subjunctive fell out of use, with the optative or imperative being used instead, or merged with the optative as in Latin.
So the "-ra" and "-se" forms always had a past (to be specific, pluperfect) meaning, but only the "-se" form always belonged with the subjunctive mood that the "-re" form had since its emergence.
Comfort with the subjunctive form and the degree to which a second-language speaker attempts to avoid using it is a good way to gauge his or her fluency in the language.
* ''De ce să plece?''
Spanish has two past subjunctive forms.
* ''Si...'': "If.." (e.g.
The same two tenses as in German are sometimes considered subjunctive mood (''aanvoegende wijs'') and sometimes conditional mood (''voorwaardelijke wijs'').
It can also express emotion, opinion, disagreement, denial, or a wish.
The same alterations could be made to the expression ''Sea como sea'' or "no matter how" with similar changes in meaning.
* In the past tense, the singular form of the subjunctive of weak verbs (the vast majority of verbs) does not differ from the indicative at all, so that for those verbs there is no difference between indicative and subjunctive whatsoever in the past tense.
It is called the past subjunctive when referring counterfactually to the present, and is called the pluperfect subjunctive when referring counterfactually to the past.
These irregularities apply to verbs whose stem ends already in a stressed vowel and thus due to the rules of Irish orthography and pronunciation, can't take another.
There is also some irregularity in certain verbs in the subjunctive.
* ''Să ne (să-ţi, să vă) fie de bine!''
The present subjunctive is used in questions having the modal value of ''should'':
* Es importante que (nosotros) hagamos ejercicio.
* ''Upieram się, że wychodzi'' indicative - I insist that he leaves;
However, using 'würde' instead of ''hätte'' (KII form of ''haben'' 'to have') and ''wäre'' (KII form of ''sein'' 'to be') can be perceived anywhere from awkward (in the Present Konjunktiv II) to incorrect (in the Past-Time Konjunktiv II).
In addition, the Romance languages tend to use the subjunctive in various kinds of subordinate clauses, such as those introduced by words meaning ''although'' English: "Although I am old, I feel young"; French: ''Bien que je sois vieux, je me sens jeune''.
It is distinct from the imperfect indicative in most of its forms: where the indicative has "-u", the subjunctive has "-a"; and where the indicative has "-na" or "-ni", the subjunctive has nothing at all.
# in the third-person singular of any verb in the present form;
It occurs in ''that'' clauses following the main-clause verb "wish" ("I wish that she '''were''' here now"; "I wish that she '''had been''' here yesterday") and in ''if'' clauses expressing a condition that does not or did not hold ("If she '''were''' here right now, ..."; "If she '''had been''' here yesterday, ...").
Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred; the precise situations in which they are used vary from language to language.
The present subjunctive is often used as an imperative, mainly for other persons than the second person.
Final short vowels were elided in Hebrew in prehistoric times, so that the distinction between the Proto-Semitic indicative, subjunctive and jussive (similar to Classical Arabic forms) had largely been lost even in Biblical Hebrew.
Nevertheless, in some texts in which the pronoun thou is used, a final ''-est'' or ''-st'' is sometimes added; for example, ''thou beest'' appears frequently in the work of Shakespeare and some of his contemporaries.
In Early Modern English, the past subjunctive was distinguishable from the past indicative not only in the verb ''to be'' (as in Modern English) but also in the second-person singular of all verbs.
– ''suggestion or question''
(Not shown in the table is the pluperfect subjunctive, which uses the ''had''-plus-past-participle construction when the counterfactual time of action is the past.)
Present negative indicative
Its spoken form makes use of it to a much larger degree than other Latin languages and it is in no case homonymous to any other tense.
They must have at least one of the following criteria.
that I '''not own'''that he/she/it '''not own'''that we/you/they '''not own'''
* ''Cuando'': "When.." (referring to a future time, e.g.
Egyptian Arabic uses a simple construction that precedes the conjugated verbs with (''law'' "if") or (''momken'' "may"); the following are some examples:
(Note: the same construction can be used for all persons and numbers.)
The distinction does remain for some verbal categories, where the original final morphemes effected lasting secondary changes in word-internal syllabic structure and vowel length.
– May the Devil make thunder of your soul in Hell.
Compare to the closely related optative mood, e.g.
For example, "I would like" can be said in the conditional ''Me gustaría'' or in the past subjunctive ''Quisiera'', as in ''Quisiera'' (past subjunctive) ''que vinieras'' (past subjunctive), i.e.
(The form is similar to the imperfect subjunctive, but with a "-re" ending instead of "-ra," "-res" instead of "-ras," and so on.)
* third plural masc.
However, the first-person forms of the subjunctive continue to be used, as they are transferred to the imperative, which formerly, like Greek, had no first person forms.
*'''feoigh''' ''(to decay; wither)
Subordinate clauses in Babylonian and Standard Babylonian Akkadian are marked with a ''-u'' on verbs ending in a consonant, and with nothing after vocalic endings or after ventive endings.
(Past subjunctive + past pluperfect subjunctive): "Whatever/no matter what it may have been".
The KII is formed from the stem of the preterite (imperfect) form of the verb and appending the appropriate Konjunktiv I ending as appropriate, although in most regular verbs the final 'e' in the stem is dropped.
the subjunctive ''nie nalegam, by wysłał list'' vs the optative ''oby wysłał list''.
E.g., the subjunctive "''God '''zegene''' je, mijn kind''" (May God bless you, my child) differs from the indicative "''God '''zegent''' je, mijn kind''" (God blesses you, my child.)
''yaktubūna'' "they write" → Subjunctive ''yaktubū'' "they may write"
* The verb in the second clause is the one that is in subjunctive.
Normally, only certitude of (or statement of) a fact will remove the possibility of its use.
* ''Upieram się, by wyszedł'' subjunctive - I insist that he leave;
Hence, the present subjunctive of "to go" is "I go", "you go", "he/she/it go", "we go", "they go".
* Italian: "Stia attento!"
