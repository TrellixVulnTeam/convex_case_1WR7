Such behavior at times made Bradford uncomfortable, but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the Pokanoket.
He was buried in Duxbury's Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Cemetery.
The leaders of Plymouth Colony had already hired him for that role, but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process.
He supported and defended the Pilgrims' colony for much of his life, though there is no evidence to suggest that Standish ever joined their church.
Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, "You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man.
Little is definitively known of Myles Standish's origins and early life.
The site of Myles Standish's house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was, but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of Duxbury.

One of the colonists of Wessagusset named Phineas Pratt verified that his settlement was in danger.
Nathaniel Philbrick refers to Standish as a "mercenary", suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in Holland,  but Justin Winsor claims that Standish received a lieutenant's commission in the English army and was subsequently promoted to captain in Holland.

Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, "Let him begin when he dare...he shall not take us unawares."
Standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to Plymouth in April 1626.
In his younger time he went over into the low countries, and was a soldier there, and came acquainted with the church at Leyden, and came over into New England, with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of New Plymouth, and bare a deep share of their first difficulties, and was always very faithful to their interest.

Bradford called a public meeting at which the Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight, including Hobbamock, to Wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the English settlements.
