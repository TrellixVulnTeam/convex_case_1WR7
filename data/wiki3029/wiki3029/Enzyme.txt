This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the development of cancers.
At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate.
Enzymes are used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required.
Some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation.
Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates.

Oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as pancreatic insufficiency and lactose intolerance.
Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines.
Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions.
In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.
Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity.
This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products.

Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules.
Another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain.
Following Buchner's example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out: the suffix ''-ase'' is combined with the name of the substrate (e.g., lactase is the enzyme that cleaves lactose) or to the type of reaction (e.g., DNA polymerase forms DNA polymers).
Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux through the rest of the pathway.
Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.

The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages.
Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering its activation energy.
In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex.

As with all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction.
This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively.
For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways.
For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.

Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells.
In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.
Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates.
In 1958, Daniel Koshland suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme.
Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.
This early model explains enzyme specificity, but fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.
