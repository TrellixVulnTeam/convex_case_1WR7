The scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs.
Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands.
These photo-receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities.
The length is thought to be related to sperm competition.
It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.
Many of these early "stem-birds", such as ''Archaeopteryx'', were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.
In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.
Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.
Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat.
Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.
Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.
Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years.
The jacanas ''Actophilornis'' and ''Irediparra'' have an expanded, blade-like radius.
This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.
Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time.
Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice.
They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents.
Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.
The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (''Jacana'', ''Hydrophasianus''), the spur-winged goose (''Plectropterus''), the torrent duck (''Merganetta'') and nine species of lapwing (''Vanellus'') use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon.
The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small.
Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction.
Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution.
The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria.
Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur clade Theropoda.
Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana.
Greater roadrunner (''Geococcyx californianus'')
Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet.
The forelimbs are modified into wings.
The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.
Some basal members of this group, such as ''Microraptor'', have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly.
Though some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.
Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.
Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.
Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's breeding colonies up to  inland in Antarctica.
The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland.
Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.
One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.
Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand.
Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the Euornithes (meaning "true birds", because they include the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms.
Cross-fertilisation between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.
As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.
Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers.
Plants and pollinating birds often coevolve, and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.
Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen.
It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.
Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.
In music, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as Ottorino Respighi first did; or like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg, they can duet with birds.
Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as  of body weight per day of incubation.
The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock.
Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser.
Most birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.
The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.
Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.
Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators.
At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.
The ''chick guard stage'' describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched.
The scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.
Inbreeding depression occurs in the great tit (''Parus major'') when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness.
In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.
The earliest fossil remains of true birds come from the possible galliform ''Austinornis lentus'', dated to about 85 million years ago, but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists.
Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.
Brood parasites may be either ''obligate brood parasites'', which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or ''non-obligate brood parasites'', which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.
Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.
The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs.
Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they are members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others.
Darwin’s finch ''Geospiza scandens'' experiences inbreeding depression (reduced survival of offspring) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.
The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).
Homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.
There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage.
Due largely to the discovery of ''Vegavis'', a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage, Aves is known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era.
Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to structural collisions or long-line fishing bycatch, pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use), competition and predation from nonnative invasive species, and climate change.
Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets.
Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.
Some species, including frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds.
Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions.
Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, give most birds the ability to fly, although further speciation has led to some flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds.
The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving group of dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs.
Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing.
Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%.
This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.
'''Birds''' ('''Aves''') are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton.
The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones.
This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.
Birds prominently figure throughout human culture.
The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions.
Ninety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous.
Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.
The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building.
DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs.
Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.
Birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species.
These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere.
# Aves can mean all reptiles closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternately Avemetatarsalia =Panaves)
During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and ''Archaeopteryx lithographica''.
Most researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary.
In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.
Conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behaviour are "honest" traits.
Wild turkey (''Meleagris gallopavo'')
Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.
Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.
Magellanic penguin (''Spheniscus magellanicus'')
The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.
The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a 'burden'.
The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking.
Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication.
The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food.
Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.
Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food.
Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the "non-breeding" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—"basic" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as "alternate" plumages.
Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.
As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.
When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs.
The well-known early avialan, ''Archaeopteryx'', dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from Germany.
This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.
While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements.
This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows.
Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.
This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock.
In several civilisations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the "auspex" (from which the word "auspicious" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.
Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.
Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.
The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates.
Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.
Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.
While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.
This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication.
Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals.
Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.
A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers.
They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling.
Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity.
Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas.
Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling.
Birds have two sexes: either female or male.
However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings.
However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system.
Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated.
Although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered.
The diversity of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species.
Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes.
These two subdivisions are often given the rank of superorder, although Livezey and Zusi assigned them "cohort" rank.
The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart.
Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.
Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.
Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores.
Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.
The later included the superficially gull-like ''Ichthyornis'', the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.
As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart.
In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation.
One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.
Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.
Birds live worldwide and range in size from the  bee hummingbird to the  ostrich.
Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.
Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.
Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species.
Unlike ''Archaeopteryx'' and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.
(2014) with some clade names after  Yury, T. et al.
The chicks of the ''Synthliboramphus'' murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.
These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.
Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds.
Among the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society.
Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine.
Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.
''Archaeopteryx'' was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds.
Several avian characteristics are compared in the table below.
Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves.
Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.
# Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group").
Southern pied babblers ''Turdoides bicolor'' appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways.
Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances.
Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents.
Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins, and also members of the duck family, have also evolved for swimming.
Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India.
The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.
Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.
Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his ''Odyssey'', and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2.
Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe.
At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species.
The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail.
Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females.
The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.
Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling.
However, one recent study demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio.
Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.
The sex of birds is determined by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals.
Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods.
The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock.
Laysan albatross (''Diomedea immutabilis'')
The most recent effort is drawn above and is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 representative species.
Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song.
There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes.
Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of .
Aves and a sister group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria.
Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food.
Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.
In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly.
After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood.
Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.
The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where "dances" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.
