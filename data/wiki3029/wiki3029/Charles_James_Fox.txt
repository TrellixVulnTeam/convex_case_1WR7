George in return thought that Fox had "cast off every principle of common honour and honesty ... a man who is as contemptible as he is odious ... and has an aversion to all restraints."
In Paris, he presented his wife, Elizabeth Armistead, for the first time in seven years of marriage, creating yet another stir back at court in London, and had three interviews with Napoleon, who – though he tried to flatter his most prominent British sympathiser – had to spend most of the time arguing about the freedom of the press and the perniciousness of a standing army.
Meetings of the people, therefore, for the discussion of public objects were not merely legal, but laudable."
They were especially pleased with his fight for the abolition of the slave trade.
Fox was the darling of his father, who found Charles "infinitely engaging & clever & pretty" and, from the time that his son was three years old, apparently preferred his company at meals to that of anyone else.
Fox contributed to the peaceful resolution of these entanglements, and gained a new admirer in Catherine the Great, who bought a bust of Fox and placed it between Cicero and Demosthenes in her collection.
When, in 1790, the comte de Mirabeau disparaged Fox in Pitt's presence, Pitt stopped him, saying, "You have never seen the wizard within the magic circle."
He had declared that Pitt was "a rascal" and Fox "his Friend".
Fox became a prominent and staunch opponent of George III, whom he regarded as an aspiring tyrant; he supported the American Patriots, even dressing in the colours of George Washington's army.
Fox, who occasionally corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and had met Benjamin Franklin in Paris, predicted that Britain had little practical hope of subduing the colonies, and interpreted the American cause approvingly as a struggle for liberty against the oppressive policies of a despotic and unaccountable executive.
In later life he was said always to have carried a copy of Horace in his coat pocket.
However, with the coming of the American War of Independence and the influence of the Whig Edmund Burke, Fox's opinions evolved into some of the most radical ever to be aired in the Parliament of his era.
Moreover, the Foxites were "the witty and wicked" satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.
On 18 April, Fox spoke in the Commons – together with William Wilberforce, Pitt and Burke – in favour of a measure to abolish the slave trade, but – despite their combined rhetorical talents – the vote went against them by a majority of 75.
The distance from the stress and noise of Westminster was an enormous psychological and spiritual relief to Fox, but still he defended his earlier principles: "It is a great comfort to me to reflect how steadily I have opposed this war, for the miseries it seems likely to produce are without end."
On 1 May 1798 Fox proposed a toast to "Our Sovereign, the Majesty of the People".
It was said that Charles once expressed a great desire to break his father's watch and was not restrained or punished when he duly smashed it on the floor.
On 6 May 1791, a tearful confrontation on the floor of the Commons (officially, and rather irrelevantly, during a debate on the particulars of a bill for the government of Canada) finally shattered the quarter-century friendship of Fox and Burke, as the latter dramatically crossed the floor of the House to sit down next to Pitt, taking the support of a good deal of the more conservative Whigs with him.
In his last days, the sceptical Fox allowed scriptural readings at his bedside in order to please his religious wife.
Fox is also commemorated in a termly dinner held in his honour at his ''alma mater'', Hertford College, Oxford, by students of English, history and the romance languages.
On 6 April 1780, John Dunning's motion that "The influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished" passed the Commons by a vote of 233 to 215.
Fox supported Pitt’s reforms, despite apparent political expediency, but they were defeated by 248 to 174.
These three pursuits – gambling, womanising and the love of things and fashions foreign – would become, once inculcated in his adolescence, notorious habits of Fox’s later life.
George now felt justified in dismissing Fox and North from government and in nominating William Pitt in their place; at twenty-four years of age, the youngest British Prime Minister in history was appointed to office, apparently on the authority of the votes of 19 peers.
He again absented himself to Bath from 27 January to 21 February 1789.
Fox was the subject of the frontispiece of John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer-prize winning book ''Profiles in Courage'': "He well knows what snares are spread about his path, from personal animosity…and possibly from popular delusion.
Though Fox had little interest in the actual exercise of power and spent almost the entirety of his political career in opposition, he became noted as an anti-slavery campaigner, a supporter of the French Revolution, and a leading parliamentary advocate of religious tolerance and individual liberty.
Fox's finances were often "more the subject of conversation than any other topic."
Fox believed that it was "impossible to support the Revolution of 1688 and the Brunswick Succession upon any other principle" than the sovereignty of the people.
Fox was born at 9 Conduit Street, London, the second surviving son of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland and Lady Caroline Lennox, a daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond.
In August Lord Lauderdale was sent to join Yarmouth (with full negotiating powers) and he reported back to Fox of "the complete system of Terror which prevails here", with French friends of Fox too frightened to call on him.
But I think that he has no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not".
The Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, formally ending the American Revolutionary War.
A supporter of the Grafton and North ministries, Fox was prominent in the campaign to punish the radical John Wilkes for challenging the Commons.
Fox is remembered in his home town of Chertsey by a bust on a high plinth (''pictured left''), erected in 2006 in a new development by the railway station.
The trial was also expedient for Fox in that it placed Pitt in an uncomfortable political position.
He married her in a private ceremony at Wyton in Huntingdonshire on 28 September 1795, but did not make the fact public until October 1802, and Elizabeth was never really accepted at court.
But Fox enjoyed a swell of extra-parliamentary support during the course of the controversy.
When war broke out again in May 1803, Fox blamed the Prime Minister Henry Addington for not standing up to the King.
He went on several further expeditions to Europe, becoming well known in the great Parisian salons, meeting influential figures such as Voltaire, Edward Gibbon, the duc d'Orléans and the marquis de Lafayette, and becoming the co-owner of a number of racehorses with the duc de Lauzun.
This was the period when Fox, hardening against the influence of the Crown, was embraced by the radical movement of the late eighteenth century.
Thompson thought it "Fox's greatest service to the common people, passed at the eleventh hour before the tide turned toward repression."
Pitt pointed out that the Prince of Wales had no more right to the throne than any other Briton, though he may well have – as the King's firstborn – a better claim to it.
…He may live long, he may do much.
Pitt thought of sending Fox to the Tower of London for the duration of the parliamentary session but instead removed him from the Privy Council.
Indeed, in many ways the King considered Fox his son's tutor in debauchery.
In Fox's own constituency of Westminster the contest was particularly fierce.
Behind these incidents lay his family's resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom.
He was taken out of school by his father in 1761 to attend the coronation of George III, who would become one of his most bitter enemies, and once more in 1763 to visit the Continent; to Paris and Spa.
But the fact that such a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court.
They celebrated his opposition to war in alliance with European despots against the people of France eager for their freedom, and they praised his fight for liberties at home.
Even after the American defeat at Long Island in 1776, Fox stated that
In 1795, he wrote to his nephew, Lord Holland:
Fox spoke ten times in the debate on the acts.
In October 1801 a preliminary peace agreement between Britain and France was published and Fox was delighted.
In many ways, the Pittite-Foxite division of Parliament after the French Revolution established the basis for the ideological Conservative-Liberal divide of the nineteenth century.
In March 1803 he believed that Napoleon's belligerence towards Piedmont, Malta and Switzerland was regrettable but did not constitute a ''casus belli'', writing to the Duchess of Devonshire "if I am to shew a feeling for the wounded honour of the country you or somebody must shew me the wound, for the life of me I cannot find as single instance since the definitive treaty where the Govt.
The triumph of the French Government over the English does in fact afford me a degree of pleasure which it is very difficult to disguise".
But here is the summit.
One of Pitt’s first major actions as Prime Minister was, in 1785, to put a scheme of parliamentary reform before the Commons, proposing to rationalise somewhat the existing, decidedly unrepresentative, electoral system by eliminating thirty-six rotten boroughs and redistributing seats to represent London and the larger counties.
The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France.
When Pitt (who had taken over from Addington as premier in 1804) tried to persuade Prussia into an anti-French alliance, Prussia refused, to Fox's delight.
Around July 1794 their fear of France outgrew their resentment towards Pitt for his actions in 1784, and they crossed the floor to the Government benches.
Sarah Siddons kept a portrait of Fox in her dressing room.
According to the document, Fox was a "false patriot; having often insulted the French nation in his speeches, and particularly in 1786."
of France has behaved ill to ''us''".
Indeed, the act was passed by Parliament on 21 May, the same day as a royal proclamation against seditious writings was issued, and more libel cases would be brought by the government in the following two years than had been in all the preceding years of the eighteenth century.
The Duke of Norfolk had made the same toast in January at Fox's birthday dinner and had been dismissed as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding as a result.
Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.
Negotiations over Hanover, Naples, Sicily, and Malta faltered and Talleyrand vetoed Russian participation in the negotiations.
In 1792, Fox had seen through the only piece of substantial legislation in his career, the Libel Act 1792, which restored to juries the right to decide what was and was not libellous, in addition to whether a defendant was guilty.
He had amassed a considerable fortune by exploiting his position as Paymaster General of the forces.
In his ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'', Burke warned that the revolution was a violent rebellion against tradition and proper authority, motivated by utopian, abstract ideas disconnected from reality, which would lead to anarchy and eventual dictatorship.
Fox used his parliamentary majority to oppose Pitt's nomination, and every subsequent measure that he put before the House, until March 1784, when the King dissolved Parliament and, in the following general election, Pitt was returned with a substantial majority.
The Fox-North Coalition came to power on 2 April 1783, in spite of the King's resistance.
After the subsequent Peace of Amiens was signed in March 1802, Fox joined the thousands of English tourists flocking across the Channel to see the sights of the revolution.
Fox was to address the House of Commons some 254 times between 1768 and 1774 and rapidly gathered a reputation as a superb orator, but he had not yet developed the radical opinions for which he would become famous.
Fox could not believe that they "would disgrace" themselves in such a way.
Also crucial to any understanding of Fox's political career from this point was his mutual antipathy with George III – probably the most enthusiastic prosecutor of the American war.
On this trip, Charles was given a substantial amount of money with which to learn to gamble by his father, who also arranged for him to lose his virginity, aged fourteen, to a Madame de Quallens.
Fox's following in Parliament had shrivelled to about 25, compared with around 55 in 1794 and at least 90 during the 1780s.
While Fox drew up lists for his proposed Cabinet under the new Prince Regent, Pitt spun out the legalistic debates over the constitutionality of and precedents for instituting a regency, as well as the actual process of drawing up a Regency Bill and navigating it through Parliament.
"George III let it be widely broadcast that he held Fox principally responsible for the Prince’s many failings, not least a tendency to vomit in public."
"He thus opened his career by speaking in behalf of the Commons against the people and their elected representative."
"Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power."
Therefore, peace talks were speedily entered into by Fox and his old friend Talleyrand, now French foreign minister.
Whig households would collect locks of Fox's hair, books of his conflated speeches and busts in his likeness.
Fox is also portrayed in the 1999 BBC mini series ''Aristocrats''.
Yarmouth confirmed that Russia was negotiating separately with France.
Consequently, both Fox and his brother, Stephen, were insulted and pelted with mud in the street by the pro-Wilkes London crowds.
His father Henry, a leading Whig of his day, had similarly been the great rival of Pitt's famous father.
Edward Gibbon remarked that "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood."
Fox proposed an East India Bill to place the government of the ailing and oppressive British East India Company, at that time in control of a considerable expanse of India, on a sounder footing with a board of governors responsible to Parliament and more resistant to Crown patronage.
George III, also observing Fox's licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted to take anything seriously.
However, there was more than naked thirst for power in Fox's seemingly hypocritical Tory assertion.
Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that "friendship was the only real happiness in the world."
Fifteen of the eighteen Managers appointed to the trial were Foxites, one of them being Fox himself.
Though there were few developments in France after 1792 that Fox could positively favour (the guillotine claimed the life of his old friend, the duc de Biron, among many others) Fox maintained that the old monarchical system still proved a greater threat to liberty than the new, degenerating experiment in France.
Although Fox had wanted to be buried near his home in Chertsey, his funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 10 October 1806, the anniversary of his initial election for Westminster in 1780.
Though Fox was to die before abolition was enacted, he oversaw a Foreign Slave Trade Bill in spring 1806 that prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain’s wartime enemies, thus eliminating two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.
Fox believed that the King's illness was permanent, and therefore that George III was, constitutionally speaking, dead.
It is difficult to find two figures in history more greatly contrasted in temperament than Fox and George: the former a notorious gambler and rake; the latter famous for his virtues of frugality and family.
A statue of Fox stands, alongside other notable Parliamentarians, in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster.
Later, Fox successfully supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, extending the rights of British Catholics.
He will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory: he will remember…that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph.
Fox was also probably the most ridiculed figure of the 18th century – most famously by Gillray, for whom he served as a stock Jacobin villain.
It was at this time that Fox and his supporters took up the habit of dressing in buff and blue: the colours of the uniforms in Washington’s army.
However, Fox was apparently not greatly bothered by these criticisms, and indeed kept a collection of his caricatures.
The experience of these years was crucial in Fox's political formation.
His younger brother, Henry (1755–1811), had a distinguished military career.
For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster.
Henry Fox (1705–1774) was an ally of Robert Walpole and rival of Pitt the Elder.
It was posthumously published in 1808 as ''A History of the Early Part of the Reign of James II''.
Fox entered Hertford College, Oxford, in October 1764, although he would later leave without taking a degree, rather contemptuous of its "nonsenses".
During the French Revolutionary Wars Fox supported the French Republic against the monarchies that comprised the Second Coalition.
Having opposed the Addington ministry (though he approved of its negotiation of the Peace of Amiens) as a Pitt-style tool of the King, Fox gravitated towards the Grenvillite faction, which shared his support for Catholic emancipation and composed the only parliamentary alternative to a coalition with the Pittites.
Fox and Pitt went down in parliamentary history as legendary political and oratorical opponents who would not be equalled until the days of Gladstone and Disraeli more than half a century later.
Fox and his retinue were kept under surveillance by officials from the British embassy during their trip of 20 July to 17 November.
Strikingly, particularly after 1794, the word 'Whig' gave way to the word 'Foxite' as the self-description of the members of the opposition to Pitt.
Fox, however, still insisted on challenging the repressive wartime legislation introduced by Pitt in the 1790s that would become known (rather exaggeratedly) as "Pitt's Terror".
When Yarmouth reported successive new French demands, Fox replied that the British government "continues ardently to wish for the Conclusion of Peace".
It passed the Commons by 153 to 80, but, when the King made it clear that any peer who voted in favour of the bill would be considered a personal enemy of the Crown, the Lords divided against Fox by 95 to 76.
Fox was famed for his rakishness and his drinking; vices which were both indulged frequently and immoderately.
Fox thought of revolutionary France as the lesser of two evils, and emphasised the role of traditional despots in perverting the course of the revolution: he argued that Louis XVI and the French aristocracy had brought their fates upon themselves by abusing the constitution of 1791 and that the coalition of European autocrats, which was currently dispatching its armies against France's borders, had driven the revolutionary government to desperate and bloody measures by exciting a profound national crisis.
Fox's argument did indeed seem to contradict his lifelong championing of Parliament's rights over the Crown.
The liberals saluted his rights for parliamentary reform, Catholic Emancipation, intellectual freedom, and justice for the Dissenters.
Many of his friends were shocked at such open language, but as Fox said in his reply to a remonstrance from Grey: "...the truth is, I am gone something further in hate to the English Government than perhaps you and the rest of my friends are, and certainly further than can with prudence be avowed.
Fox's private life (as far as it was private) was notorious, even in an age noted for the licentiousness of its upper classes.
Fox was also an infamous gambler, once claiming that winning was the greatest pleasure in the world, and losing the second greatest.
However, the King and Pitt had great popular support, and many in the press and general population saw Fox as the trouble-maker challenging the composition of the constitution and the King's remaining powers.
Fox opposed the bellicose stances of Pitt's ministry in the Nootka Sound crisis, and over the Russian occupation of the Turkish port of Ochakiv on the Black Sea.
He never can exceed what he does this day."
Pitt, on the other hand, considered the King's madness temporary (or, at least, hoped that it would be), and thus saw the throne as temporarily unoccupied rather than vacant.
His friend, Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, said of him that, since "the respect of the world was not easily retrievable, he became so callous to what was said of him, as never to repress a single thought, or even temper a single expression when he was before the public."
Fox enjoyed riding and cricket but, in the latter case, the combination of his impulsive nature and considerable weight led to his often being run out between wickets.
While not wholly forgotten today Fox is no longer the famous hero he had been, and is less well remembered than Pitt.
But he has put to hazard his ease, his security, his interest, his power, even his…popularity.
On 28 December 1772, North appointed Fox to the board of the Treasury and again he surrendered his post, in February 1774, over the Government's allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates.
Fox warned the Commons that
Based on this single conjunction of interests and the fading memory of the happy co-operation of the early 1770s, the two men who had vilified one another throughout the American war together formed a coalition and forced their Government, with an overwhelming majority composed of North's Tories and Fox's opposition Whigs, on to the King.
Between 1772 and 1774, Fox's father had – shortly before dying – had to pay off £120,000 of Charles' debts; the equivalent of around £11&nbsp;million at today's prices.
However, the King forced Fox and North out of government before the end of the year, replacing them with the twenty-four-year-old Pitt the Younger, and Fox spent the following twenty-two years facing Pitt and the government benches from across the Commons.
The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, and the more so from his having no pretensions to it".
The King soon regained lucidity in time to prevent the establishment of his son’s regency and the elevation of Fox to the prime ministership, and, on 23 April, a service of thanksgiving was conducted at St Paul’s in honour of George III’s return to health.
Selwyn also said that "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no consideration on earth but for what was useful to his own ends.
I like the Peace the more on this very account".
Parliament passed the acts.
In 1787, the most dramatic political event of the decade came to pass in the form of the Impeachment of Warren Hastings, the Governor of Bengal until 1785, on charges of corruption and extortion.
In a speech to his constituents on 10 October Fox said: "We have not, I acknowledge, obtained the objects for which the War was undertaken—so much the better—I rejoice that we have not.
Fox's stay in France enabled him, through his connections with Talleyrand and Lafayette, to search the French archives for his planned history of the reign of James II, the Glorious Revolution and the reign of William III.
On one occasion, Fox, who returned enthusiastically to the post of Foreign Secretary, ended an epistle to the King: "Whenever Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to condescend even to hint your inclinations upon any subject, that it will be the study of Your Majesty's Ministers to show how truly sensible they are of Your Majesty's goodness."
He negotiated a number of restrictions on the powers of the Prince of Wales as regent (which would later provide the basis of the Regency Act of 1811), but the bill finally passed the Commons on 12 February.
Pitt, in turn, came to the defence of the Acts as adopted
After Pitt's death in January 1806, Fox served briefly as Foreign Secretary in the 'Ministry of All the Talents' of William Grenville, before he died on 13 September 1806, aged 57.
Fox was appalled at what he called this "extraordinary step".
In the end Fox was re-elected by a very slender margin, but legal challenges (encouraged, to an extent, by Pitt and the King) prevented a final declaration of the result for over a year.
King George believed this was a ploy to divide Britain and Russia as French interests would suffer if she had to deal with an Anglo-Russian alliance, with Fox forced to agree that the King's belief was "but too well founded".
Fox was convinced (as he had been since Napoleon's accession) that France desired a lasting peace and that he was "sure that two civil sentences from the Ministers would ensure Peace".
The stories of Charles's over-indulgence by his doting father are legendary.
Fox now found himself in common opposition to Shelburne with his old and bitter enemy, Lord North.
On 2 March 1790, Fox gave a long and eloquent speech to a packed House of Commons.
A substantial petitioning movement arose in support of him, and on 16 November 1795, he addressed a public meeting of between two- and thirty-thousand people on the subject.
Fox continued to defend the French Revolution, even as its fruits began to collapse into war, repression and the Reign of Terror.
He argued that, according to the principles of the proposed legislation, Pitt should have been transported a decade before in 1785, when he had been advocating parliamentary reform.
When North finally resigned under the strains of office and the disastrous American war in March 1782 and was gingerly replaced with the new ministry of the Marquess of Rockingham, Fox was appointed Foreign Secretary.
Many of the Foxites purposefully seceded from Parliament in 1797; Fox himself retired for lengthy periods to his wife's house in Surrey.
Briefly serving as Britain's first Foreign Secretary in the ministry of the Marquess of Rockingham in 1782, he returned to the post in a coalition government with his old enemy Lord North in 1783.
Fox thought it "glorious", saying on 24 April that
His round face was dominated by his luxuriant eyebrows, with the result that he was known among the Whigs as 'the Eyebrow.'
Fox would increasingly spend time away from Parliament at Armistead's rural villa, St. Ann's Hill, near Chertsey in Surrey, where Armistead's influence gradually moderated Fox's wilder behaviour and together they would read, garden, explore the countryside and entertain friends.
Burke, with fear of the radical upheaval in France foremost in his mind, took Pitt's side in the debate, dismissing Nonconformists as "men of factious and dangerous principles", to which Fox replied that Burke's "strange dereliction from his former principles ... filled him with grief and shame".
Fox was also regarded as a notorious womaniser in a period when a mistress was considered a practical necessity for a London gentleman.
Fox was not surprised when Pitt and the King brought Britain into the war as well, and would afterwards blame the pair and their prodigal European subsidies for the long-drawn-out continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars.
As the Lords too prepared to pass it, they learned that the King’s health was improving and decided to postpone further action.
By July 1800 Fox had "forgiven" the means by which he had come into power and claimed Napoleon had "surpassed...Alexander & Caesar, not to mention the great advantage he has over them in the Cause he fights in".
…He is traduced and abused for his supposed motives.
Fox thought the ''coup d'état'' of 1799 that brought Napoleon to power "a very bad beginning ... the manner of the thing was quite odious", But he was convinced that the French leader sincerely desired peace in order to consolidate his rule and rebuild his shattered country.
He told the Commons that:
Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart".
Humbly Dedicated to the Lord Chancellor'' in 1787.
After Pitt's resignation in February 1801, Fox had undertaken a partial return to politics.
The King was placed under restraint and a rumour went round that Fox had poisoned him.
Fox's elder brother, Stephen (1745–1774) became 2nd Baron Holland.
In 1811, the Prince of Wales took the oaths of office as regent with a bust of Fox at his side.
On 10 June 1806, Fox offered a resolution for total abolition to Parliament: "this House, conceiving the African slave trade to be contrary to the principles of justice, humanity, and sound policy, will, with all practicable expedition, proceed to take effectual measures for abolishing the said trade..." The House of Commons voted 114 to 15 in favour and the Lords approved the motion on 25 June.
In response to the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, he famously declared, "How much the greatest event it is that ever happened in the world!
His portrait hangs in the foyer.
Fox became convinced that the King was determined to challenge the authority of Parliament and the balance of the constitution established in 1688, and to achieve Continental-style tyranny.
By the end of his life, Fox had lost about £200,000 gambling.
be to the Duty I owe to K. & Country".
After these defections, the Foxites could no longer constitute a credible parliamentary opposition, reduced, as they were, to some fifty MPs.
Fox's friend, the Earl of Carlisle, observed that any setback for the British Government in America was "a great cause of amusement to Charles."
His friendship with his mentor Burke and his parliamentary credibility were both casualties of Fox's support for France during the Revolutionary Wars, but he went on to attack Pitt's wartime legislation and to defend the liberty of religious minorities and political radicals.
Fox refused to serve in the successor administration of the Earl of Shelburne, splitting the Whig party; Fox's father had been convinced that Shelburne – a supporter of the elder Pitt – had thwarted his ministerial ambitions at the time of the 1763 peace.
In June Lord Yarmouth was sent on a peace mission to Paris.
Fox spoke in opposition to the King's Speech on 13 December 1793, but was defeated in the subsequent division by 290 to 50.
Fox's motion was defeated in the Commons by 294 votes to 105.
However, by July the mood had completely changed and Fox was forced to acknowledge that his assessment of Napoleon's pacific intentions were wrong.
He argued that "the best security for the due maintenance of the constitution was in the strict and incessant vigilance of the people over parliament itself.
Although the matter was really Burke’s area of expertise, Fox was, at first, enthusiastic.
