As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined.
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a supernova explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago.
By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behaviourial responses.
Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes testable predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay.
This perspective is represented by philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Noam Chomsky, among others.
This was the subject of the famous Bohr–Einstein debates between Einstein and Niels Bohr and there is still no consensus.
: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point.
Other proponents of emergentist or generative philosophy, cognitive sciences and evolutionary psychology, argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true.
Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of libertarian free will, by making arguments based on generative processes (emergence).
This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.
The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably.
Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
Thus the unpredictability of the emerging behaviour from deterministic processes leads to a perception of free will, even though free will as an ontological entity does not exist.
Proponents of this view include Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche, among others.
In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.
When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition.
Traditionally, the view relies on strict notions of causality, and most philosophical arguments in its favor have attempted at clear definitions of cause and effect as a basis for the belief that determinism is true.
Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will".
calculating the trajectory of a bullet).
A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
Cultural determinism or social determinism is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.
Notably, the idea that the past choices of seemingly rational agents could have been performed differently - or even the idea that the future decisions of such agents will turn out to be other than what they will - is usually challenged under this view.
Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.
Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters.
Relevant is the fact that certainty is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction).
The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later.
Furthermore, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.
Behaviorism involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive.
Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will.
The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.
The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.
Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism.
Whether or not determinism poses a real threat to traditional notions of responsibility, morality, or legal process is disputed among philosophers.
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), quantum mechanics can be said to be deterministic.
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future.
Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false.
The hard incompatibilists hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the libertarianists that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.
As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a single-cause fallacy.
On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself.
In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes wave functions that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language.
In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.
There are those who doubt this claim, and instead view the truth of determinism to follow suit with other revolutions throughout history, such as the theory of relativity or the theory of evolution.
As contentious as this is also whether the truth of determinism introduces any challenges to meaning and purposeful effort - or the value of decision making and seemingly important life choices - most notably in the form of nihilism or fatalism.
The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.
Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science.
They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.
Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality implies a single wave function for the entire universe, starting at the origin of the universe.
This is true of most models involving differential equations (notably, those measuring rate of change over time).
These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the brain reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses.
Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.
The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other.
Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist).
The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom, an issue that is known in theology as the paradox of free will.
The three incompatibilist positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility.
But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied.
As an illustration, the strategy board-games chess and Go have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no random events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game.
"Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one which quantum particles do not meaningfully possess.
In his book, ''The Moral Landscape'', author and neuroscientist Sam Harris also argues against free will.
adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."
Biological determinism, sometimes called genetic determinism, is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
The truth of determinism is often acknowledged - at bottom - as a belief, rather than a fact or scientifically viable theory or law.
These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future.
Compatibilism refers to the view that free will is, in some sense, compatible with determinism.
This would suggest there are no hidden variables, although many physicists believe better experiments are needed to conclusively settle the issue (see also Bell test experiments).
Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, quantum mechanics—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of events.
At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g.
A critical finding was that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions which would be violated if local hidden variables really existed.
The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called ''nondeterminism'').
One gram of uranium-238, a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 1021 atoms.
Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to numerical instability and a finite amount of precision in measurement.
The former usually involves argumentation within metaphysics, and the latter, that of its ethical, political, and existential relevance.
Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves.
In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human.
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on morality.
In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable.
In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of Karma on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept.
This is an example of the butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory.
Many mathematical models of physical systems are deterministic.
O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.
However, addressing free will is its own concern, and any discussion of determinism does not demand any discussion of free will.
Compatibilistic free will (which is deterministic) may be the only kind of "free will" that can exist.
He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism.
Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"
Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target).
Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an alpha particle.
Philosopher and incompatibilist Peter van Inwagen introduces this thesis as such:
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and cognition, others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on nature and nurture.
In the West, some elements of determinism seem to have been expressed by the Presocratics Heraclitus and Leucippus.
If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc.
If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that that man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"
Just the opposite is also argued, that determinism actually posits a more meaningful aspect to life, in the form of rational optimism, usually in the form of celebrating the idea that everything happens for a reason, as well as the idea that one need not fully regret one's past experience if it had to have been necessarily carried out as it was - or even the passionate exercise of asserting one's fate.
Some research (founded by the John Templeton Foundation) suggested that reducing a person's belief in free will is dangerous, making them less helpful and more aggressive.
This creates the four possible positions in the figure.
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
"These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."
Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.
Although it was once thought by scientists that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that nervous systems are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to chaos theory.
Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.
Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior.
(''See'' cosmic inflation, primordial fluctuations and large-scale structure of the cosmos.)
There have been a number of experiments to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated.
Before that, Newtonian physics—the physics of everyday life—dominated.
see Schrödinger's cat - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).
It is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states.
In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.
However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around.
That is, he believes there is compelling evidence of absence of free will.
Environmental determinism, also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture.
The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "hidden variables" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen.
It is associated with the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx.
However, Daniel Dennett, in his book Elbow Room, says that this means we have the only kind of free will "worth wanting".
The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.
This final note verges on - or fully engages in - the territory of the philosophy of language.
John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner developed this nurture-focused determinism.
Economic determinism is the theory which attributes primacy to the economic structure over politics in the development of human history.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is frequently confused with the observer effect.
Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic.
However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not.
In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the Uncertainty principle).
None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of quantum mechanics are not still up for debate.
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.
Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics.
The time dependent Schrödinger equation gives the first time derivative of the quantum state.
Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen.
Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect.
Adequate determinism (see Varieties, above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls Libertarian free will "just an illusion".
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
The implication of this is that given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible to achieve.
In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true).
Determinism in the West is often associated with Newtonian physics, which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws.
This could occur because the individual's sense of self-efficacy suffers.
Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved.
Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations.
In this scenario, the winning player would be able to announce a checkmate happening in at most a given number of moves assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or less moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion.
If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''Laplace's demon'').
Hard determinism (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible.
They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior.
At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's half life.
These findings from quantum mechanics have found many applications, and allow us to build transistors and lasers.
O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale.
They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).
Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the scientific method, logic and empiricism.
'''Determinism''' is the philosophical doctrine that all events transpire in virtue of some necessity and are therefore inevitable.
For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.
Thus, the "problem" of free will - or the idea of free will as being an "illusion" - often arises as a result of the main claim made by determinism, that is, that the past, present, and future is identifiable with an essentially unbreakable chain of circumstances of which no single link in such a chain could possibly be avoided or altered.
Certain philosophers of science argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not.
Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the radioactivity of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability.
Mecca Chiesa notes that the probabilistic or selectionistic determinism of B.F. Skinner comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not mechanistic at all.
This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g.
As Stephen Hawking explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.
They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors.
Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results.
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.
They suggest instead that an illusion of free will is experienced due to the generation of infinite behaviour from the interaction of finite-deterministic set of rules and parameters.
This is where statistical mechanics come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description.
Argument that Free Will is Required for Moral Judgments
When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, there are endgame tables available which dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.
Linguistic determinism claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know.
The writings of Epictetus as well as Middle Platonist and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.
Psychological determinism can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of Psychological egoism.
It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist philosophies.
Supporters of environmental determinism often also support Behavioral determinism.
However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind.
The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus.
Another hands-on example of generative processes is John Horton Conway's playable Game of Life.
It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of free will given various possible reactions to the problem in the first place.
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will.
For even more discussion, see Free will.
On the topic of predictable probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example.
This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
See Karma in Hinduism.
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
The concept of heritability has been helpful in making this distinction.
So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way.
The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god: "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad?
Some (including Albert Einstein) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no mind-body dichotomy, and there is a Materialistic explanation for intuitions to the contrary.
Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined.
The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle).
Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse).
Taken in isolation (rather than as an approximation to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways.
Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions.
This implies that its supposed truth would always be restricted to philosophical speculation and argumentation rather than by scientific demonstration or formally proven within the mathematical basis of physics or even within theoretical physics.
Some determinists deny the idea of any true "possibility" or "randomness" within reality altogether, even asserting that such ideas are only a creation of the mind and/or merely the result of imagination - ultimately a result of ignorance in the face of real explanations for such phenomena - which could otherwise, in principle, be either derived by reason or discovered by empirical experimentation.
"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action."
Newtonian mechanics as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance.
On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.
Physicist Aaron D. O'Connell explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does.
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
An example is the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Nassim Taleb is wary of such models, and coined the term "ludic fallacy".
These matters continue to be subject to some dispute.
In addition to these issues, the length to which language can actually capture what exactly is at stake, assuming that anything is at stake at all - or even what the true nature of reality really is in spite of how convincing the nature of the concept of determinism seems to be - is itself disputed.
That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the wave function with time.
