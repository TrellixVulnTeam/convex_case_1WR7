Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such an analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as an indication of animal intelligence.
Like other placental mammals, cetaceans give birth to well-developed calves and nurse them with milk from their mammary glands.
Generally, underwater noise, which is still on the increase, is increasingly tied to strandings; because it impairs communication and sense of direction.
This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around , the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.
The causes are not clear.

The meat, blubber and oil of cetaceans have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic.
Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths.
This milk usually has a high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46%, causing the calf to increase rapidly in size and weight.

The Greeks paid tribute to both whales and dolphins with their own constellation.
This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height.
This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements that can be observed in many species.
The primary threats to cetaceans come from people, both directly from whaling or drive hunting and indirect threats from fishing and pollution.
They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface.

Common anatomical features include similarities in the morphology of the posterior molars, and the bony ring on the temporal bone (bulla) and the involucre, a skull feature that was previously associated only with cetaceans.
This reproductive strategy provides a few offspring that have a high survival rate.
Cetaceans produce a number of vocalizations, notably the clicks and whistles of dolphins, the moaning songs of the humpback whale.
Smaller cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises, engage in complex play behavior, including such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or "bubble rings".

This means only species with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good binocular vision forward and downward.
Corresponding findings are from Tethys Sea deposits in northern India and Pakistan.
As a result, the animals are more susceptible to disease and have fewer offspring.
Cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, because they have no pointing ability.
The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they will net a tuna shoal.
Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails.
Baleen whales are largely monogamous within each reproductive period.
Food supplies are also reduced long-term by ocean acidification due to increased absorption of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.

In the 1882 children's book ''Adventures of Pinocchio'' by Carlo Collodi, the wooden figures Pinocchio and Geppettos' creators were swallowed by a whale.
Aristotle, however, observed many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy.
This complex is located in a cavity in the middle ear, which, in the Mysticeti, is divided by a bony projection and compressed between the exoccipital and squamosal, but in the odontoceti, is large and completely surrounds the bulla (hence called "peribullar"), which is, therefore, not connected to the skull except in physeterids.

The nostrils are located on top of the head above the eyes so that the rest of the body can remain submerged while surfacing for air.
The two main methods of bubble ring production are rapid puffing of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed.
