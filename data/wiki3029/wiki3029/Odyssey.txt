Father and son meet; Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but still not to Eumaeus), and they decide that the Suitors must be killed.
She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents, Arete and Alcinous, or Alkinous.
This dating places the destruction of Troy, ten years before, to 1188 BC, which is close to the archaeologically dated destruction of Troy VIIa circa 1190 BC.
Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its non-linear plot, and the influence on events of choices made by women and slaves, besides the actions of fighting men.
It is important to note who receives the omens and what these omens mean to the characters and to the epic as a whole.
Agamemnon's son, Orestes, out of vengeance for his father's death, kills Aegisthus.
Odysseus builds a raft and is given clothing, food, and drink by Calypso.
Released by the intercession of his patroness Athena, through the aid of Hermes, he departs, but his raft is destroyed by his divine enemy Poseidon, who is angry because Odysseus blinded his son, Polyphemus.
The final clue is a total eclipse, falling over Ithaca around noon, when Penelope's Suitors sit down for their noon meal.
Mashu, the high mountain from which the sun comes into the sky.
Odysseus' narrative, Book 9, featuring his encounter with the cyclops Polyphemus, is traditionally called the ''Cyclopeia''.
Naked and exhausted, he hides in a pile of leaves and falls asleep.
Book 22, wherein Odysseus kills all the Suitors, has been given the title ''Mnesterophonia'': "slaughter of the Suitors".
Next Odysseus met the spirit of his own mother, who had died of grief during his long absence.
Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity.
This occurs in two distinct ways.
Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus's recent wanderings.
Menelaus, meanwhile, also praises Odysseus as an irreproachable comrade and friend, lamenting the fact that they were not only unable to return together from Troy but that Odysseus is yet to return.
After leaving Calypso's island, the poet describes Odysseus' encounters with the Phaeacians—those who "convoy without hurt to all men"—which represents his transition from not returning home to returning home.
Their leader points out that Odysseus has now caused the deaths of two generations of the men of Ithaca: his sailors, not one of whom survived; and the Suitors, whom he has now executed (albeit rightly).
Instead of immediately revealing his identity, he arrives disguised as a beggar and then proceeds to determine who in his house has remained loyal to him and who has helped the suitors.
The ''Odyssey'' has a lost sequel, the ''Telegony'', which was not written by Homer.
They conclude that these three astronomical references "'cohere', in the sense that the astronomical phenomena pinpoint the date of 16 April 1178 BCE" as the most likely date of Odysseus' return.
It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War.
As he sails away from the island of the Cyclopes, he shouts his name and boasts that nobody can defeat the "Great Odysseus".
Scholars believe it was composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.
# Odysseus is hesitant to question the loyalties of others.
# Odysseus then tests the loyalties of others by questioning them.
They then passed between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis; Scylla snatched up six men.
He offers her hospitality; they observe the suitors dining rowdily while the bard Phemius performs a narrative poem for them.
Her home is also associated with the sun: Gilgamesh reaches Siduri's house by passing through a tunnel underneath Mt.
One example of good guest-friendship is that of the Phaeacians.
They skirted the land of the Sirens, who sang an enchanting song that normally caused passing sailors to steer toward the rocks, only to hit them and sink.
This enrages Poseidon, causing the god to thwart Odysseus' homecoming for a very long time.
Many scholars believe that the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an ''aoidos'' (epic poet/singer), perhaps a rhapsode (professional performer), and was more likely intended to be heard than read.
After dinner, he tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself: He was born in Crete, had led a party of Cretans to fight alongside other Greeks in the Trojan War, and had then spent seven years at the court of the king of Egypt; finally he had been shipwrecked in Thesprotia and crossed from there to Ithaca.
He appeals to her for help.
Her island, Aeaea, is located at the edges of the world, and seems to have close associations with the sun.
All of the bird omens—with the exception of the first one in the epic—show large birds attacking smaller bird.
Odysseus essentially says that while Antinous may look like a king, he is far from a king since he is not generous.
Penelope objects to Phemius' theme, the "Return from Troy", because it reminds her of her missing husband, but Telemachus rebuts her objections.
For instance, the cyclops's "gift" to Odysseus was that he would eat him last.
The '''''Odyssey''''' (;  ''Odýsseia'',  in Classical Attic) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer.
Poseidon then cursed Odysseus to wander the sea for ten years, during which he would lose all his crew and return home through the aid of others.
In one source, the ''Telegony'' was said to have been stolen from Musaeus by Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene (see Cyclic poets).
That night Athena, disguised as Telemachus, finds a ship and crew for the true Telemachus.
The ''Odyssey'' opens ''in medias res'', in the middle of the overall story, with prior events described through flashbacks or storytelling.
Also, their analysis of the weather’s and the environment’s description (long nights, plants, animals and peoples’ habits) and the astronomical data (guiding constellations and Venus in the east horizon), constitute from their point of view, an autumn return of Odysseus to Ithaca five days before the above characterized day.
He then begins to tell the story of his return from Troy.
After Odysseus reveals his true identity, the characters test Odysseus' identity to see if he really is who he says he is.
Only two of Odysseus's adventures are described by the poet.
No one else sees the sky darken, and it is therefore not actually described as an eclipse within the story, merely a vision by Theoclymenus.
Throughout the epic, the testing of others follows a typical pattern.
West argues that the similarity of Odysseus' and Gilgamesh's journeys to the edges of the earth are the result of the influence of the Gilgamesh epic upon the ''Odyssey''.
The ''Odyssey'' was written in a poetic dialect of Greek—a literary amalgam of Aeolic Greek, Ionic Greek, and other Ancient Greek dialects—and comprises 12,110 lines of dactylic hexameter.
For more about varying views on the origin, authorship and unity of the poem see Homeric scholarship.
From there, Telemachus rides overland, accompanied by Nestor's son, Peisistratus, to Sparta, where he finds Menelaus and Helen, who are now reconciled - Helen laments her fit of lust brought on by Aphrodite that sent her to Troy with Paris.
This parallel compares the death of the suitors to the death of Aegisthus and sets Orestes up as an example for Telemachus.
Eurycleia tries to tell Penelope about the beggar's true identity, but Athena makes sure that Penelope cannot hear her.
After the escape, Odysseus and his crew stayed with Aeolus, the ruler of the winds.
Also, during Odysseus' journey, he encounters many god-like or beings that are close to the gods.
Finally, guided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbor at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead.
Scholars have seen strong influences from Near Eastern mythology and literature in the ''Odyssey''.
While they were escaping, however, Odysseus foolishly told Polyphemus his identity, and Polyphemus told his father, Poseidon, that Odysseus had blinded him.
Martin West has noted substantial parallels between the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' and the ''Odyssey''.
It continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world.
Odysseus is welcomed and is not at first asked for his name.
Circe, surprised by Odysseus' resistance, agreed to change his men back to their human form in exchange for Odysseus' love.
Athena disguises Odysseus as a wandering beggar so he can see how things stand in his household.
# The characters reply to Odysseus' questions.
The problem with this is that the 'eclipse' is only seen by Theoclymenus, and the Suitors toss him out, calling him mad.
An example of Odysseus testing the loyalties of others is when he returns home.
After unsuccessfully pleading with Aeolus to help them again, they re-embarked and encountered the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.
Telemachus goes home first.
He first encountered the spirit of Elpenor, a crewman who had gotten drunk and fallen from a roof to his death, which had gone unnoticed by others, before Odysseus and the rest of his crew had left Circe.
They suffered a shipwreck as they were driven towards Charybdis.
This ''Telegony'' aside, the last 548 lines of the ''Odyssey'', corresponding to Book 24, are believed by many scholars to have been added by a slightly later poet.
Having listened with rapt attention to his story, the Phaeacians, who are skilled mariners, agree to help Odysseus get home.
He is ridiculed by the Suitors in his own home, especially by one extremely impertinent man named Antinous.
Many modern and ancient scholars take this to be the original ending of the ''Odyssey'', and the rest to be an interpolation.
This concludes the Greek Epic Cycle, though fragments remain of the "alternative ending" of sorts known as the ''Telegony''.
He was not a very good host.
Calypso keeps Odysseus concealed from the world and unable to return home.
These scenes are told by the poet to represent an important transition in Odysseus' journey: being concealed to returning home.
In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the ''Mnesteres'' (Greek: ) or Proci, who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage.
Returning to Circe's island, they were advised by her on the remaining stages of the journey.
This is best seen when Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, begs Antinous, one of the suitors, for food and Antinous denies his request.
The next morning, Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca to discuss what should be done with the suitors.
He gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home.
There are difficulties in the apparently simple identification of Ithaca, the homeland of Odysseus, which may or may not be the same island that is now called Ithake.
# There is a rise of emotions associated with Odysseus' recognition, usually lament or joy.
He also hears from Helen, who is the first to recognize him, that she pities him because Odysseus was not there for him in his childhood because he went to Troy to fight for her and also about his exploit of stealing the Palladium, or the Luck of Troy, where she was the only one to recognize him.
She is persuaded to release him by Odysseus' great-grandfather, the messenger god Hermes, who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea.
Odysseus then summoned the spirit of the prophet Tiresias for advice on how to appease Poseidon upon his return home.
For more information on the progression of testing type scenes, read more below.
Finally, Odysseus asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the Trojan Horse, a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role.
Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as Mentor), he departs for the Greek mainland and the household of Nestor, most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, now at home in Pylos.
In the Classical period, moreover, several of the books (individually and in groups) were given their own titles: the first four books, focusing on Telemachus, are commonly known as the ''Telemachy''.
All ancient and nearly all modern editions and translations of the ''Odyssey'' are divided into 24 books.
Another theme throughout the ''Odyssey'' is testing.
Odysseus' protectress, the goddess Athena, discusses his fate with Zeus, king of the gods, at a moment when Odysseus' enemy, the god of the sea Poseidon, is absent from Mount Olympus.
It is, in part, a sequel to the ''Iliad'', the other work ascribed to Homer.
This direct relationship between Zeus and Odysseus represents the kingship of Odysseus.
He finds his way to the hut of one of his own slaves, the swineherd Eumaeus.
Another host that was not well versed in guest-friendship was Calypso, who did not allow Odysseus to leave her island.
The next day he and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father Laertes, who likewise accepts his identity only when Odysseus correctly describes the orchard that Laertes had previously given him.
When Odysseus washes up on Scherie, home to the Phaeacians, he is assisted by the young Nausicaa and is treated hospitably.
Many scholars believe it was developed by Alexandrian editors of the 3rd century BC.
Both Helen and Menelaus also say that they returned to Sparta after a long voyage by way of Egypt.
All of the sailors had their ears plugged up with beeswax, except for Odysseus, who was tied to the mast as he wanted to hear the song.
The wanderings of Odysseus as told to the Phaeacians, and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of Scheria, pose more fundamental problems, if geography is to be applied: scholars, both ancient and modern, are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after Ismaros and before his return to Ithaca) are real.
This intelligence is most often manifested by his use of disguise and deceptive speech.
Finally, he met the spirits of famous men and women.
The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon, and is the second oldest extant work of Western literature, the ''Iliad'' being the oldest.
In the first episodes, we trace Telemachus' efforts to assert control of the household, and then, at Athena's advice, to search for news of his long-lost father.
is the one that was referred by Theoclymenus.
But he has consistently spurned her advances.
Telemachus and Penelope receive their omens as well in the form of words, sneezes, and dreams.
Several passages in earlier books seem to be setting up the events of Book 24, so if it were indeed a later addition, the offending editor would seem to have changed earlier text as well.
In the ''Odyssey'' specifically, there are several omens involving birds.
For instance, Penelope tests Odysseus' identity by saying that she will move the bed into the other room for him.
Doctors Baikouzis and Magnasco state that "the odds that purely fictional references to these phenomena (so hard to satisfy simultaneously) would coincide by accident with the only eclipse of the century are minute."
The Cyclops' origins have also been surmised by paleontologist Othenio Abel in 1914, to be the results of Ancient Greeks finding an elephant skull.
These finding scenes can be identified several times throughout the epic including when Telemachus and Pisistratus find Menelaus, when Calypso finds Odysseus on the beach, and when the suitor Amphimedon finds Agamemnon in Hades.
When Poseidon learns that Odysseus has escaped, he wrecks the raft, but, helped by a veil given by the sea nymph Ino, Odysseus swims ashore on Scherie, the island of the Phaeacians.
The second is a new moon on the night before the massacre of the Suitors.
The second part tells the story of Odysseus.
They visited the lethargic Lotus-Eaters who gave two of his men their fruit which caused them to forget their homecoming, and then were captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus, escaping by blinding him with a wooden stake.
This division is convenient but it may not be original.
They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca.
Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his own house, still pretending to be a beggar.
The first is an otherwise obscure incident of the Trojan War, the "Quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles"; the second is the amusing tale of a love affair between two Olympian gods, Ares and Aphrodite.
She is hesitant, but recognizes him when he mentions that he made their bed from an olive tree still rooted to the ground.
For instance, bird omens are shown to Telemachus, Penelope, Odysseus, and the suitors.
Notably he encountered the spirit of Agamemnon, of whose murder he now learned, and Achilles, who told him about the woes of the land of the dead (for Odysseus' encounter with the dead, see also ''Nekuia'').
Two important parts of an omen type scene is the recognition of the omen and then the interpretation.
She turned half of his men into swine after feeding them cheese and wine.
Elpenor's ghost told Odysseus to bury his body, which Odysseus promised to do.
It was usually attributed in antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta.
He then throws off his rags and kills Antinous with his next arrow.
He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and makes for Eumaeus's hut.
It is because of Penelope that Odysseus has fame and a successful homecoming.
Also, because Odysseus knows about Clytemnestra's betrayal, Odysseus returns home in disguise in order to test the loyalty of his own wife, Penelope.
When Odysseus' dog (who was a puppy before he left) saw him, he becomes so excited that he dies.
Then, disguised as a Taphian chieftain named Mentes, she visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father.
Odysseus tests the loyalty of others and others test Odysseus' identity.
Both Odysseus and Gilgamesh are known for traveling to the ends of the earth, and on their journeys go to the land of the dead.
After a piratical raid on Ismaros in the land of the Cicones, he and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms.
However, the greedy sailors naively opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking it contained gold.
The details of the ancient oral performance, and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars.
When asked by other Cyclopes why he is screaming, Polyphemus replies that "Nobody" is hurting him, so the others assume that, "If alone as you are Polyphemus none uses violence on you, why, there is no avoiding the sickness sent by great Zeus; so you had better pray to your father, the lord Poseidon".
All of Odysseus' ships except his own entered the harbor of the Laestrygonians' Island and were immediately destroyed.
Meanwhile, Telemachus sails home from Sparta, evading an ambush set by the Suitors.
For example, Telemachus wishes for vengeance and for Odysseus to be home, Penelope wishes for Odysseus' return, and the suitors wish for the death of Telemachus.
After he has spent seven years in captivity on Ogygia, the island of Calypso, she falls deeply in love with him.
His disguises take forms both physical (altering his appearance) and verbal, such as telling the Cyclops Polyphemus that his name is , "Nobody", then escaping after blinding Polyphemus.
This is a difficult task since it is made out of a living tree that would require being cut down, a fact that only the real Odysseus would know, thus proving his identity.
Upon Agamemnon's return, his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, kill Agamemnon.
The Cyclops then throws the top half of a mountain at him and prays to his father, Poseidon, saying that Odysseus has blinded him.
Then, with the help of Athena, Odysseus, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and Philoteus the cowherd kill the rest of the Suitors, first using the rest of the arrows and then by swords and spears once both sides have armed themselves.
Books 9 through 12, wherein Odysseus recalls his adventures for his Phaeacian hosts, are collectively referred to as the ''Apologoi'': Odysseus' "stories".
An important factor to consider about Odysseus' homecoming is the hint at potential endings to the epic by using other characters as parallels for his journey.
He remains for several days, takes part in a pentathlon, and hears the blind singer Demodocus perform two narrative poems.
The events in the main sequence of the ''Odyssey'' (excluding Odysseus' embedded narrative of his wanderings) take place in the Peloponnese and in what are now called the Ionian Islands.
While Odysseus was away praying, his men ignored the warnings of Tiresias and Circe, and hunted the sacred cattle of the sun god Helios as their food had run short.
These beings that are close to the gods include the Phaeacians who lived near Cyclopes, whose king, Alcinous, is the great-grandson of the king of the giants, Eurymedon, and the grandson of Poseidon.
Within the Odyssey, omens frequently involve birds.
Calypso's name means "concealer" or "one who conceals," and that is exactly what she does with Odysseus.
Omens are another example of a type scene in the ''Odyssey.''
This device is also used by later authors of literary epics, such as Virgil in the ''Aeneid'', Luís de Camões in ''Os Lusíadas'' and Alexander Pope in ''The Rape of the Lock''.
On his voyage to the underworld, Odysseus follows instructions given to him by Circe, a goddess who is the daughter of the sun-god Helios.
The Phaeacians feed Odysseus, give him a place to sleep, and give him a safe voyage home, which are all things a good host should do.
Some of the other characters that Odysseus encounters are Polyphemus who is the cyclops son of Poseidon,  Circe who is the sorceress daughter of the Sun that turns men into animals, Calypso who is a goddess, and the Laestrygonians who are cannibalistic giants.
Another important factor of guest-friendship is not keeping the guest longer than they wish and also promising their safety while they are a guest within the host's home.
Odysseus takes part in the competition himself: he alone is strong enough to string the bow and shoot it through the dozen axe heads, making him the winner.
The first clue is Odysseus' sighting of Venus just before dawn as he arrives on Ithaca.
There, on the island of Pharos, Menelaus encountered the old sea-god Proteus, who told him that Odysseus was a captive of the nymph Calypso.
Another important factor to guest-friendship is that kingship implies generosity.
These encounters are useful in understanding that Odysseus is in a world beyond man and that influences the fact he cannot return home.
All but Odysseus were drowned; he clung to a fig tree above Charybdis.
Odysseus' heroic trait is his ''mētis'', or "cunning intelligence": he is often described as the "Peer of Zeus in Counsel".
# Finally, the reconciled characters work together.
Zeus caused a storm which prevented them leaving.
Like Odysseus, Gilgamesh gets directions on how to reach the land of the dead from a divine helper: in this case, the goddess Siduri, who, like Circe, dwells by the sea at the ends of the earth.
He sailed on and visited the witch-goddess Circe.
It is assumed that a king has the means to be a generous host and is more generous with his own property.
For instance, one example is that of Agamemnon's homecoming versus Odysseus' homecoming.
The Sun God insisted that Zeus punish the men for this sacrilege.
In the English language as well as many others, the word ''odyssey'' has come to refer to an epic voyage.
While testing is a theme with the epic, it also has a very specific type scene that accompanies it as well.
Later, Agamemnon praises Penelope for not killing Odysseus.
The most evident flaw that Odysseus sports is that of his arrogance and his pride, or ''hubris.''
Odysseus then swears Eurycleia to secrecy.
An early example of this is the boar hunt that gave Odysseus the scar by which Eurycleia recognizes him; Odysseus is injured by the boar and responds by killing it.
After this, Ithaca is at peace once more, concluding the ''Odyssey''.
The seer Theoclymenus approaches the Suitors and foretells their death, saying, "The Sun has been obliterated from the sky, and an unlucky darkness invades the world."
The omens seen in the ''Odyssey'' are also a recurring theme throughout the epic.
Book 11, the section describing his meeting with the spirits of the dead is known as the ''Nekuia''.
''The Odyssey'' was written in dactylic hexameter.
The next day, at Athena's prompting, Penelope maneuvers the Suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus' bow.
