Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.
An exception to this rule is in Hawaii, where upslope flow due to the trade winds lead to one of the wettest locations on Earth.
As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.
There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics.
The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control.
The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops.
The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.

The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed.
The band of precipitation that is associated with their warm front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band, which is wide and stratiform, meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds.
Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between  downwind of cities, compared with upwind.
Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.

Thermal infrared (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops.
Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.
The corresponding depletion of water vapour causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense.
This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas.
Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g.
North and south of this are regions of descending air that form subtropical ridges where precipitation is low; the land surface underneath is usually arid, which forms most of the Earth's deserts.

In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.
Once the snowfall/ice is finished accumulating, or as 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in) is approached, one can either bring it inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice/snow is melted.
The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted again.
When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours.

Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus.
Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.
A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season, but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front.

On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating.
IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection—such as the tropics—and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions.
No two snowflakes are alike, which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground.
Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds.
Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes.

Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice.
Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land.
The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier.
Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13&nbsp;°C or 23&nbsp;°F) between the water surface and the air above.

Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters.
It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity.
Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.
Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers.
Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones.
